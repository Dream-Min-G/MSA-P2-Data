Hi partners checking in here from my doctor ordered quarantine I was exposed to COVID19 and roughly ten days later started becoming symptomatic To keep it simple I feel like garbage I will never taking breathing for granted again But to why Im commenting here The 30 days leave is great Its a really cool step forward once the details are ironed out I know my SM checked in to let me know my 14 day catastrophe pay was approved but she has zero information about the 30 days leave Shes waiting on information from our DM They found out when we did which blows BUT BUT BUT P L E A S E if you take it STAY INSIDE This isnt a 30 day vacation its a safety precaution This isnt the time to be gathering in bars if theyre even open or to have parties Stay home and stay safe Order delivery if you can contactless if theres an option and tip well I know my friends who do deliveries cant stop and theyre relying on these tips Keep social distancing Flatten the curve We dont know what a week from now or a month from now will look like but we can do our part now Flatten the damn curve stay hydrated and Ill see you on the other side,80.0,2020-03-22 07:27:09,0.0,0.062,0.798,0.14,0.9611

I mentioned this in another thread but my store is closing for the duration Our SM made the call to give every partner the leave with no consultation I didnt find out for sure until she called me this morning Im not thrilled with how the decision was made but being able to care for myself and my boyfriend and his parents is my priority right now Im hoping all of you are able to be safe and well too,34.0,2020-03-22 05:15:44,0.0,0.076,0.739,0.184,0.905

Ok nice to see that Starbucks is a global shit show Heres what happened today in my store in Germany you cant make this shit up On Friday evening my state announced that all restaurants will be closed due to Covid19 A couple of days earlier Amrest sent out a FAQ mail which clearly stated that Starbucks is considered a restaurant There was a point before that where it wasnt clear if the Bux was considered retail or food service industry and it was important to know because of the frequently updated bans and shutdowns made by the state I met up today with my SM and another barista to take inventory and prep the store to close for the unforeseeable future when around 11 am we got a call that other coffee chains were still open downtown and we had about an hour to open ours again too I dont know if its a legit loophole but Amrest claims that since were only doing takeout came in effect only today lol were not a regular restaurant and therefore allowed to operate That the Bux doesnt care isnt anything new we shouldve closed a while ago not only for the customers safety but for ours too But the couple hours where it was announced that were closed and Amrest wants to ensure 90 of payment instead of 60 were a real pleasant surprise I really feel like BooBoo The Fool for believing that they actually care lol As soon as it was known that others were still open and the Bux can have a slice of that money cake they grabbed that opportunity and flipped us off Now other SMs are telling us to be reasonable and grateful that we still have a job Im sorry Maam but that sounds fucked up Were dealing with a pandemic,13.0,2020-03-22 10:43:10,0.0,0.073,0.808,0.119,0.9354

UPDATE Im a shift supervisor at Starbucks and have worked there for about a year and a half I requested to take the 30 days off My reasoning was that I am a clarinet major in college and the virus attacks the lungs If the virus were to damage my lungs permanently I would have to change career paths I know its not a super intense reason but it was my reasoning Corporate claimed I didnt meet a required standard and therefore would NOT be paid for my 30 days off but I could still choose to not work for 30 days I of course asked what the standards were and my manager responded saying even she didnt know the standards Dont expect to get paid everyone Starbucks has chosen to stay greedy during a national crisis,26.0,2020-03-22 10:27:52,0.0,0.119,0.881,0.0,-0.9304

So as far as I know only one person at my store has taken any sort of time off due to illness As nice as it is that we have the option to not come in no one is taking it because no one wants to screw over the rest of the people who arent and no one wants to be the one person that means we dont have enough coverage and will have to close The sentiment is nice but the peer pressure on the individual employees means that likely not many people will end up taking advantage of this offer imo,19.0,2020-03-22 05:34:46,0.0,0.053,0.849,0.097,0.418

Yes I am incredibly thankful for the 1 month of paid time at home Yes Im incredibly thankful for the extra 3hour through may Im very thankful that I still have my job and that my company is trying But this doesnt mean that my notsohappy feelings about Starbucks are invalid We are officially back to work on May 4th I believe we are open to the public on the 5th I love my bosses I love my fellow shifts I love my baristas and I am so broken up about us going back to work so soon While we will be DTonly wearing masks etc but COVID19 hasnt even peaked in our state yet While it was amazing to have that month of social distancing that surely helped a lot of people but the surge of COVID19 in our area is predicted in midMay or even midJune In our state and county Starbucks meets the criteria for essential businesses so we can legally be open Social distancing and stay at home measures are not being enforced Our numbers looked better when there was enough fear to keep people at home but earlier in the month many people decided that the risk was low enough that they could resume life as normal which is of course putting themselves and everyone else at high risk So what happens when COVID19 inevitably hits our community hard and 35 of us are still coming into contact daily with each other and with the public How many of us will get sick I know that I can use my sick and vacation time but its not like I have months saved up only a few days I know that I can apply for a leave of absence but I cant not get paid I dont qualify for the stimulus check I know that at the end of the day Starbucks is a business that has to be open to function But at what cost We have already used our one month and the worst is yet to come Will they let us close again or do we just have to suck it up Im scared for me Im scared for my coworkers and my community Ive thought about writing a letter to corporate but what can I even say Its not like I have a solution either I guess if nothing else this qualifies as a rantcry for help Even if you can only commiserate I appreciate any input I can get Im just feeling dejected and disheartened I dont know where to go from here,7.0,2020-04-25 10:33:15,0.0,0.126,0.776,0.098,-0.9492

my SM decided to close our DT store dont get me wrong this company is making me sick with how poorly theyve handled this but some managers are doing their part my SM called to tell me that shes made the decision to shut down our store and offered me the 30 days of pay i obviously took itill be fine even if i get sick and my roommate is in the same boat im much more concerned about our older regulars who started coming through the drivethru after closing our cafe and im upset about the customers treating our store like a restaurant because its the only thing thats open im tired of giving medicine balls to customers who cough and sneeze all over their handfuls of change before paying i recognize that i very well might be in the minority as a closed DT store and im so stupidly fortunate but im sending good vibes to every one of you who still has to come to work we cant forget how corporate chose to treat us during a pandemic even when its over EDIT typos,15.0,2020-03-22 12:42:36,0.0,0.097,0.775,0.127,0.6524

My store is one of the last few open Starbucks in the area we are cafe DT so our DT was still open My SM is very obviously confused and taken aback by all of this and is trying to get it all figured out but he has said that he is trying his best to figure out what all this stuff is corporate dumped on us Until then he said we are gon na remain open but if anyone feels uncomfortable he will honor any requests to stay home THAT BEING SAID Everyone at work today was awesome We were pretty busy but customers were being so nice Everyone was thanking us profusely for being open and almost every other customer gave us a tip Someone even gave us a 10 We got pizza danced and generally had a good time One of my shifts told me right now to not take the 30 days because my SM is still trying to make sense of this confusing situation which I get honestly and it seemed like my shift was looking out for me bc she said that after the 30 days who knows what Starbucks will do next so she said to reserve it until we close down She also said our store is likely gon na be closing soon within a few weeks But Im still worried and every day I still feel scared going to work If theres anything to learn through all of this is that ITS GON NA BE OKAY Were all going to get through this If you guys dont feel safe then STAY HOME But I genuinely think Starbucks is going to be closing altogether soon Stay safe guys,4.0,2020-03-22 13:19:07,0.0,0.075,0.804,0.121,0.9649

I dont think there is enough proper options provided by Starbucks for those with underlying conditions My DM and SM pretty much said unpaid leave or we can just separate from employment The shifts at my Starbucks dont take precautions seriously and to keep myself safe I had to take the cat pay People wouldnt be washing hands or sanitizing properly etc Not to mention Starbucks isnt essential and we cant properly social distance even if we wanted to With CS and support having to move in and out of areas and the cramped bar partners are constantly crossing paths long enough that they could be asymptomatic and spreading the illness Also the fact that they go from one area and touch that surface to another to touch another surface Take into account if anyone doesnt properly sanitize and its a recipe for an outbreak I know SB stand on nurturing the community I know that a lot of truly essential workers nurses first responders etc rely on their daily cup of coffee And Im glad SB is standing up to the company slogan But given our job and how cramped they make the stores which is a whole other complaint I have We should have been closed for at least 2 weeks completely And we should have more resources and options for people who cant risk going back with underlying conditions,4.0,2020-05-20 14:38:58,0.0,0.031,0.881,0.088,0.9264

As if Starbucks wasnt already bad and degrading enough to work for THEY ARE OKAY WITH US DYING FOR SOME BOURGEOISIE KARENS FRAPPUCINO We are given inadequate PPE that cant protect against anything doesnt even form a seal against the face and is basically as effective as doing nothing The only thing it DOES do is work like a surgical mask to keep our germs in and protect the customers the only people corporate does care about while leaving us exposed We like everyone else have had dumb customer come in to get mobile orders They touch us when we pass them drinks theyve even lowered their masks to ask questions about the app or complain about orders THIS IS WHY WE NEED A UNION If we had an organization by us for us with access to corporate information and the ability to check corporate decisions such as whatever process they used to inform their PPE policies sure as hell didnt involve consulting anyone with knowledge of PPE and advocate for ourselves We can refuse to work we can tear the profits right out of their greedy moneygrubbing hands We can stop operating equipment refuse to fill orders shut shit down picket workplaces physically bar new hires and interviews from entering the venue during the time in which wed be scheduled to be on shift We need to start looking at union tactics and deploying them again because those corporate swine have had their boots on our necks for too long and its about time we grabbed that boot twisted the ankle in it shoved the person it belongs to the ground and smash them until they listen This is a matter of life and death Our lives and deaths not theirs If they make me fight for my life or my partners lives Ill do it Profits are not worth dying over,7.0,2020-05-16 07:29:44,0.0,0.134,0.787,0.079,-0.9535
My store is literally crumbling right before my eyes I had to create this throwaway There are shifts at my store who are telling us baristas that those who dont show up to work are weak and lazy and that being uncomfortable about COVID19 is not real and is just an excuse to not work and get paid Like actually mocking some of the partners who have decided to take their 30 days They also seem to believe that we can pick and choose when we can use our 30 days when the announcement clearly says in bold italics the NEXT 30 days Are other stores experiencing this type of negativity Its really defeating to say the least especially when so many partners have family members who are highrisk during this time What do you gain from protecting a multibillion dollar company I genuinely love my job and partners but being put in this situation of being afraid of not showing up and being seen as lazy or putting myself at risk of getting infected I want to cry Can anyone here relate I am so lost,4.0,2020-03-22 15:54:49,0.0,0.144,0.787,0.069,-0.9548

How did your stores react to the 30 days PTO news My partners and I almost all consider each other friends We have a group chat where we talk just for fun pretty much When we all received the notification about the possibility of 30 days of pay we all hopped on a group call and talked for almost two hours Almost all of us lived with high risk family members and dreaded going to work This opportunity was what we had been waiting for At first there was confusion in the call what does this mean How does this work Huh Then it was should we ask our manager right now To avoid flooding our manager with the same question one of us contacted him about the notification He responded saying he would be having a conference call at 930 pm and would get back to us when it finished up Together we decided to at least let him know that we all were interested pending the details Once our manager got out of his conference call he texted us one by one He told us we can start our 30 days tomorrow Saturday at the time Sunday or Monday We sat there for about an hour deciding what our next move would be When would our last day be for the betterment of our store and to ensure no one feels abandoned We contacted the manager with the proposal to move clean play up to Saturday to ensure it gets done this week and most decided Sunday would be our last day I feel fortunate that my partners and I worked through the somewhat confusing two hours together and came up with a good game plan Im a bit sad though to see other partners have had nowhere near the same experience Some even feel guilty for taking the time off Is my store just weird in that we all said yes to this PTO I dont think anyone should feel guilty for taking this opportunity And I feel horrible for any partner who feels pressured to turn it down,3.0,2020-03-22 19:05:06,0.0,0.089,0.816,0.095,0.6697

Hi guys I hope everyones doing ok I just have a concern about the way we are dealing with the virus since now we are serving first responders by a larger quantity we become first responders too by serving them or anybody at this point everytime somebody pay with cash or credit card they are highly transmitting the virus inside the shop no matter how much we clean there is contact all day long there is not six feed distant somebody can cough at the bill and now its inside the shop and now we potentially passing to the next customer by handling their beverage and for me probably speeding it and bringing it to my family Why the same person that takes the money gives the coffee My point is if we quarantine arent we breaking the quarantine using cash or credit cards The only way to help with the situation its by taking only digital payments like Apple Pay tap Starbucks app Or have a separate person receiving payments and other just giving the coffee why Starbucks headquartered havent promote to use the app Dont this way they get more data making people get the coffee by the app Dont you know that when people order online it make it faster for us to serve and they always order more than just the coffee And also and more importantly protecting your partners and the community Lets make this happen Its just make sense,2.0,2020-03-28 09:30:18,0.0,0.028,0.878,0.094,0.9443

I know this thread is probably at a lull but I have questions regarding policies around illness and bereavement Our store has been open since the end of April and our store has gone through one 2 week shut down And three quarantines mostly involving our morning crew In that time I have noticed that a lot of partners have not been taking 30 minute breaks as it is by law that anybody that works takes a 30 minute break over six hours of working time I have also noticed that partners are still having to find coverage when they are ill or are going through a bereavement stage I used to be in contact with an SM that told me at one point that if you are sick andor are unable to come in because of being sick your SM is responsible for finding the coverage or if you are going through bereavement that is also the responsibility of your SM I am doing research to see how true this is because my SM has constantly told us to find coverage for illness or bereavement issues Im trying to build a case so that my partners can stay safe and not lose their jobs during this difficult time Any insight will be helpful and very much appreciated,1.0,2020-07-29 17:15:42,0.0,0.098,0.81,0.092,-0.3732

Everyone is worried A family member of mine who works for a fulltime business as a warehouse manager was just laid off because their whole business closed This is the first pandemic the world has seen in 11 years since the Swine Flu in 2009 Theres been two whole presidents since then excluding who was in office during it To say this is total panic and chaos is an understatement lmao Fortunately it looks like the country is bracing for increase in unemployment and financial aid so there will be a safety net should something happen In the meantime I advise you check out rpersonalfinance rpovertyfinance and look into budgeting,4.0,2020-03-22 06:32:06,0.0,0.12,0.786,0.094,-0.4939

Im not a Starbucks employee just a customer who wanted to see if all this was true but essential workers still need to eat and could use some coffee most of your stores have a drive through and a mobile order ahead option so you just grab what I assume is microwaved food that hasnt really been handled and some coffee through a window so thats as low contact as it gets other than home cooking which ICU nurses arent going to want to do after their 16 hour shifts in hell So you guys are a good choice Ill be leaving the max tip on the app as long as this is going on,-13.0,2020-03-22 08:15:46,0.0,0.118,0.835,0.047,-0.8667

This is good advice Starbucks employees have it way better than pretty much any company out there especially when you consider the heavy majority of their workers are just parttimers As a matter of fact I dont know of another company in the quick service food industry that is doing something similarregarding giving an option to come in and have a pay raise or dont come in and still get paid no matter how many hours youve previously worked or how long youve been there And it definitely would be a great opportunity to use the spare time especially if youre not working to see what is available regarding other industries that are still business as usual and remain that way no matter what happens with this corona virus thing,6.0,2020-03-27 10:55:13,0.0,0.041,0.79,0.17,0.9477

Yes Those are the vulnerable groups that get hit the hardest Now if youre between the ages ofI think they said 2145 or something like that They have the highest number of cases because theyve been refusing to selfisolate thus exposing themselves and others If youre under the age of 50 and are not immunocompromised and you take heed the advisory of the CDC and WHO you wont have to worry about an ER visit or ICU stay Listen to your body and monitor any symptoms most people are not hospitalised The most important thing is selfisolating to avoid community spread as there is a solid chunk of people who have tested positive but have been asymptomatic meaning they dont look or feel sick but are still extremely contagious,4.0,2020-03-23 12:43:24,0.0,0.102,0.815,0.082,-0.7041

I imagine it would be standard pay check timing not an allatonce kind of check So like if over the last 6 weeks you worked say 25 hrs 30 hrs 29 hrs 40 hrs 35hrs 32hrs and the average of that would be 318 I imagine it would be youd see standard pay rate at 318hrs a week for the next 4 weeks which should be about 2 paychecks Which would be just like working that solid average amount of hours across the next 4 weeks So like a months pay 2 paychecks for me back in my day wouldve been probably between 12001400 in total Math isnt my strong point but I think Im right at least right about the way I perceived it sorry if this is confusing LOL,4.0,2020-03-22 14:36:46,0.0,0.071,0.838,0.091,0.6745

Have you considered getting an antibody test when it becomes available It is possible that you had COVID19 but depending on when you had symptoms the testing protocols may had said test for flu or consider other illnesses diseases or conditions first I ran into this issue with getting tested when I did have a variety of symptoms that could had been from having COVID19 or being exposed to SARSCoV2 While the antibody test does not guarantee immunity nor indicate that you can not acquire the virus again it does provide information in how you handled exposure symptoms recovery And also may help to consider how to handle a secondary exposure Also start thinking about how you would be able to provide a list of contacts for tracing if you do test positive which I hope you do notstay as safe as possible in the future I had not thought through how I would handle the contact tracing if I tested positive and I started to stress about it once I was able to get tested This virus hit the world so fast in terms of proving lack of preparedness that I would not be surprised if a lot of people have not already been exposed andor acquired the virus Good luck stay safe as possible and hang in there,1.0,2020-04-27 22:30:58,0.0,0.087,0.779,0.134,0.9468

Thanks for the thread I was looking for more info about unemployment and this was perfect Im staying as option 1 personally but I have partners who are looking for more info That reminds me I have a question from a partner this person is under the impression that under option 2 Partner subject to recall based on business needs means they can be called in to work for a single shift like when someone noshows or calls in sick I told them that no theyd be on a leave of absence and if they brought them in before the 120 days it would be to begin genuinely working again not for singleshift fillins However I dont have a source that backs up what I say and the word recall hasnt been defined anywhere If anyone has more info as to what the rules of the recall are beyond depending on business needs Ill pass the info onto this partner PS Was going to save this for a new thread but might as well toss it in here Some of us feel that option 3 the separation package is maybe a too good to be true Its a fantastic separation package more than anyone would ever receive under normal circumstances but theres also a point to consider very few businesses are hiring right now if anyones considering this make sure youve got a plan for what happens after quitting or youd be out of a job Its possible option 2unemployment is better as it gives more time to find other work and come back to Starbs if that falls through,18.0,2020-06-05 14:37:52,1.0,0.055,0.818,0.127,0.9701

From Page 3 of the FAQ on COVID Leave of Absence Option 2 You will be credited up to 20 hours per week on approved LOA towards the benefits eligibility audit This strikes me as a sneaky loophole They refuse to guarantee 20 hours of eligibility credit So in theory I could take this option and Starbucks might decide I only get 10 hours a week 15 hours a week or no hours per week So how many hours am I actually going to get And what determines how the number of hours The only reason to take Option 2 is so that you dont fall behind on benefits requirements but if they cant actually guarantee you the minimum number of hours to hit your requirements I dont really see the point,9.0,2020-06-06 07:37:26,1.0,0.057,0.823,0.119,0.7311

2 yr Barista here Im really furious at Starbucks for faking out some people with this WHY GIVE THE OPTION I wanted to do LoA because Im working 2daysweek and yet Im getting a call saying i have to work still That just messed up a lot of plans I had for freelancing throughout the summer if I still have to work Starbucks has been making some poop covered decisions but this one takes the cake Im finding something else this job aint worth the jerking around from the CEOs,5.0,2020-06-11 03:38:54,1.0,0.093,0.894,0.014,-0.7092
So essentially Im being forced to quit Because the LOA is extremely conditional It says if we call you to work you will work My boyfriend is returning to in person work My special needs kid is out of school and Ive been getting 68 hours a week If I take the leave of absence at any time my manager can tell me come back and I have seven days to figure out what to do with a child with level 3 autism who I have to homeschool and maybe work around my boyfriends muh more important job My availability has gone from weekends only to now Sundays only Because my stores hours 100 preclude me working after he gets home from work and he is going back to doing Saturday work at his family business My availability used to be school hours and Sunday which gave me 2630 hours every week If I stay they can fire me for not being available If I take the loa they can fire me for not coming back with 1 week There is no contingency for people with extraordinary circumstances So not a special needs parent who is in essence a single parent yes I have a boyfriend but he is not my childs father is being forced to quit Awesome,9.0,2020-06-06 12:12:32,1.0,0.055,0.887,0.058,0.3912

Option 3 has confused me a bit Does it mean if I choose option 3 I get a severance pay of 60 hours the COBRA pay Or do I only get the COBRA pay if I currently have benefits I do not currently have benefits so how does this effect option 3,5.0,2020-06-06 03:29:12,1.0,0.136,0.755,0.109,0.1779
Under Option 2 to what extent can they force us to transfer to another store I have a friend with no car who can only walk to her store so she will be royally screwed if they tried to move her somewhere across town I have a car but aside from maintaining my health insurance my top priority is staying at my store We have some of the highest tips in the district so any transfer to another store is essentially a paycut,5.0,2020-06-06 05:31:42,1.0,0.046,0.901,0.053,0.1531
I picked option 2 but was pushed back by my SM and kind of cornered into picking option 1 I was told that even if I picked option 2 it would most likely be denied because the district needs shifts and I would likely be forced to work either at our store or at another store The only way I could maybe get approved is if I step down But I cant afford to do that Ive read the document over and over and nowhere did I see that I would be forced to work based on the districts needs I understand that this is just a preference and that Ill probably be forced to work anyway even though I dont feel safe or comfortable working But I just feel like I dont have an actual option here I still havent given my final decision but I feel like Im being backed into a decision,2.0,2020-06-06 05:43:29,1.0,0.159,0.746,0.096,-0.9071
Im one of the last 3 remaining shifts at my store right now meaning while my hours have been cut theyre more secure than most Is there any reason not to pick preference 3 just to see what they say I stand to gain almost twice as much money through severance and unemployment by leaving but Id lose my health insurance Either they need me or they dont in the latter case I probably wouldnt have been getting that many hours if I stayed anyways Theres also a chance my store will close soon one of the slower performing In which case I dont know whether I would be forced to transfer to a new store or have the option of being involuntarily separated,4.0,2020-06-06 06:26:22,1.0,0.088,0.86,0.052,-0.6708

So to all of my fellow baristas that chose option 3 I was told by my SM that I would get paid out a lump sum for 60 hours Today I got paid but it was the usual amount Some odd 430 That isnt 60 hours Im confused and my partner numbera already stopped so I cant get into the hub,4.0,2020-06-26 14:45:53,1.0,0.137,0.863,0.0,-0.8047

I just want to point out that there is a misprint under the Arizona tab It says you need to earn 390 times the minimum wage and then shows youd need 598750 in your highest quarter Arizonas minimum wage is 12 so youd need to have only earned 4680,3.0,2020-06-06 02:05:56,1.0,0.0,0.973,0.027,0.0772

Okay Hello all 3 year barista and leanings towards OPTION 3 Why I already was thinking about quitting by the end of the year I have another job and I picked up more hours plus I get paid more I have a little bit of debt that I wanted to pay off before I quit but OPTION 3 would help me chip away at my school debt Only thing is that option 3 seems to good to be true My store manager is new right now so he isnt being as honest with us as we would like so I confused Also he just told me today Saturday and wants an answer by tomorrow So Im stressed He said 60 hours plus pay out of my sick time and vacation time thats well over 1000 I just think its too good to be true Also Im not sure if unemployment would accept me in California if I have another job but still reduced hours I average about 45 hours a week and this would put me at about 30 hours Also what about my fidelity investments So many questions not enough answers And not a good enough leader to turn to that can answer my questions Anyone know,3.0,2020-06-07 19:45:49,1.0,0.109,0.734,0.157,0.9207

Its sadly less about your feeling safecomfortable and rather just giving people the option to not work so it frees up their labor for those that will be working If you cant afford to take a pay decrease can you afford to take an unpaid LOA You can file for unemployment but the amount you receive from that is a of what you normally made the CARES 600 that ends the week of July 25th Will that be enough to support you Otherwise if you stick with option 1 but have already seen reduced hours you can apply for PUI to help supplement while youre still working,4.0,2020-06-06 06:16:28,1.0,0.043,0.813,0.143,0.9137

Whether you receive Unemployment Insurance benefits and how much youre entitled to each week depends on how much you earned during your base period All states have similar wage requirements which are determined by the laws in each state To qualify for benefits in Arizona you must have worked for an employer who paid unemployment tax and you must have earned At least 390 times the Arizona minimum wage in your highest earning quarter and the total of the other three quarters must equal at least one half of the amount in your high quarter For example if you made 5000 in your highest quarter you need to have earned a total of 2500 within the remaining three quarters combined Or at least 7000 in total wages in at least two quarters of the base period with wages in one quarter equal to 598750 or more Unfortunately the document doesnt show that for the summaries that theyre examples taken from UI agency websites,4.0,2020-06-06 06:29:13,1.0,0.049,0.895,0.056,0.0534

If I understand this correctly from talking to my SM the thing with the preferences is that they have to talk to every partner and get all of the preferences Then they have to run those preferences against the projected hours for their store and see what can be accommodated and what cant And maybe also talk to other stores to see if they have too many partners who want to work who can take places at their store if need be or vice versa And also at some point in here theyre supposed to talk to the DM about their plan and maybe get it formally approved So your preference for Option 2 might not be able to be honored but even if it is theres a lot the SM has to do and account for first And the store still needs staffed in the meantime,6.0,2020-06-06 01:25:50,1.0,0.0,0.963,0.037,0.5346

Preference 3 doesnt have to be approved if there are enough hours and not enough partners who opted for preferences 1 2 They cant force you to work against your will but theyre not required to offer you severance and verify your unemployment if they have work available for you but you refuse Thats the same reason why you wont be elligible to continue to collect unemployment if you get called back while on the LOA and refuse to return to work Edited for wording,24.0,2020-06-05 15:39:59,1.0,0.144,0.835,0.021,-0.9081
They gave us preferences not options The point was that otherwise Starbucks would have come up with some arbitrary way to decide who they would layoff or furlough without taking anybodys preference into consideration And plenty of people did get their preference because the business allowed them to So for them it was important to be able to choose their preference,2.0,2020-06-21 01:30:17,1.0,0.0,0.971,0.029,0.2023
Can vacation time be used to cover the shifts before June 15th I was on LOA that ended a couple days ago and opted for preference 2 but today I was told Im already scheduled to work for this week coming up I literally just got the schedule a couple of hours ago and I need to cover my shifts occurring a few days from now I didnt even know I was able to be scheduled since I was on leave and Im home because I live with an atrisk family member Im not sure what to do,2.0,2020-06-06 13:19:39,1.0,0.043,0.957,0.0,-0.4104
This is true I spoke o to my SM today after I expressed the option 2 is my preference There was a phone conference today in my district that clarifies whats happening They asked all partners what their preferences and if enough people want to separate them those who chose option 2 are pretty much being called back to work with ab7 day notice So even though o wanted the leave I will be scheduled in 3 weeks time Now I have a medical leave pending which would qualify me to take a short term medical leave but it would reduce my pay to 23rds the normal pay on top of having to pay for medical insurance out of pocket which reduces that down to fucking peanuts Everything I am reading about unemployment states that being on disability disqualifies me from unemployment Im being put into a position that makes me out to be the bad guy I dont believe the company when they say they will approve people for unemployment Im tempted to separate after almost 10 years of dedication to this company and they could care less Option 2 was never really an option,3.0,2020-06-09 09:25:08,1.0,0.121,0.814,0.065,-0.8834

Yes sort of So Ive been bounced around enough by corporate that Im positive Im right at this point albeit Im not sure to what extent as there actually are higher tax rates on severance packages 2266 for California What I paid was closer to 40 and while it seems like a mountain out of a mole hill Im personally very salty I am seemingly down 100 I imagine the situation will be resolved by the end of the week but I have no idea Dm me later in the week and Ill give another update if I canit applies,2.0,2020-07-01 10:22:56,1.0,0.079,0.85,0.072,-0.408

Based on the wording from Starbucks Im understanding that you shouldnt report the severance pay until the week you actually receive it CARES Act expires end of July You only receive the extra 600 if you receive unemployment benefits during that week and the lump sum is greater than unemployment benefits so not only would you not get a payment that week you wont get the 600 Thats why it says its in our best interest to wait to return the separation documents Someone correct me if Im wrong,1.0,2020-06-17 09:09:36,1.0,0.096,0.729,0.174,0.8531

Yeah sorry bud Probably was your severance and you were probably over taxed on your state taxes but its pretty insignificant You can call and make a fuss about it like I did but itll be like for 25 or something lame like that Severance is subject to all the regular taxes payroll gets hit with in addition to an extra 22 or something If you have time to sit on the phone for 20 minutes it could be worth it for a pizza Itll probably take some time though,1.0,2020-07-11 09:48:34,1.0,0.076,0.75,0.173,0.8765

Well of course you can still quit but you wouldnt be elligible for the severance or the unemployment which means that preference three as it was described was no longer an option You took secret preference four leave the company with nothing,1.0,2020-06-18 04:53:41,1.0,0.167,0.8,0.033,-0.7506
In Seattle for some businesses depending on size you cant have your shift changed by more than 15 minutes without worker approval If they wont change you can require them to work the shift and pay an additional hour of labor for the short notice Refusing a predictability funded change is like refusing a scheduled shift If you get cut early by more than 15 minutes you get an additional hour of pay Realistically nobody I know has been punished for refusing predictability pay to stay Its more a carrot than a stick Seattle also requires a good faith estimate of hours for average hours per specific worker and has protections if that is violated and reported Which is partly why I believe these preferences were even offered Seattle requires notice and consent to reduced average hours,3.0,2020-06-07 04:38:32,1.0,0.156,0.776,0.068,-0.8821

Refusing a predictability funded change is absolutely NOT the same as refusing a scheduled shift It specifically says in the ordinance that the worker can refuse the hours The predictability pay is an incentive Note this applies to extendingadding shifts Obviously if youre sent home you cant demand to stay Edit see A2 A For employerrequested changes to the written work schedule that occur after the advance notice required in Section 1422040 1 The employer shall provide the employee with timely notice of the change by inperson conversation telephone call email text message or other accessible electronic or written format and 2 The employee may decline to work any hours not included in the employees work schedule,1.0,2020-06-12 04:31:15,1.0,0.076,0.892,0.033,-0.6286

Those evangelical bibles are basically free same with the Book of Mormon which is actually free Im not against folks who practice evangelicalism if your religion dictates that you MUST spread the word and for lack of a better word recruit more people to your faith Like Okay you do you and you follow your own church but Im strong enough in my convictions to smile and say no thank you without feeling pressured or bullied Im Catholic myself and do not practice evangelicalism Catholics dogmatically believe that spreading the word of God means living out Jesus teachings by being kind giving until it hurts opening your hearts and the doors of your church for whatever community needs arise and doing what you can to behave like Jesus did And Im the first to admit most Catholics do this very very wrong REGARDLESS of how you feel about evangelicalism faketipping is shitty behavior Jesus was friends with prostitutes queers criminals dangerouslyill people etc He would never have faked somebody out for feelgood points Hed be kind and leave an actual tip And if Jesus wasnt God he was still a cool dude that would not do shit like this You dont even have to read the Bible to know that,40.0,2020-09-16 12:55:12,2.0,0.118,0.655,0.227,0.9764

if drive thru is empty it means u can spend a bit more time chatting w partners you can go through drive if youre in a rush but sometimes its nice to chat w them outside of work it is not frowned upon to use ur free drink its a free drink might as well as take advantage of it i think this might be a joke of how some partners have very specific drinks with a bunch of mods to them i could be wrong but thats what i took from it,1.0,2020-09-16 13:57:18,4.0,0.055,0.739,0.205,0.9432
Your own crew is also likely to know your drink rather than you try to explain it to baristas that think youre a crazy Karen until you show them your ID and numbers If youre doing a lot of mods or doing simmering that isnt even a normal drink it can agitate another stores baristas for sure Drive through times are tight as well At least in my district they want times at checkout to be less than 45 seconds That means the drink has to be done and in their hands plus complete payment while managing some kind of customer connection in an extremely brief period of time The more mods and the longer a drink takes the more of a hit it is against that time When theres no one else in line that means theres no buffer of other people waiting to soak up the prep time,1.0,2020-09-16 14:13:41,4.0,0.062,0.901,0.037,-0.5859

The reason retail is considered entrylevel is because it is a job that anybody can get even people with little or no work experience These jobs could lead to career opportunities eg store manager district manager The fact of the matter is more adults than teenagers work in retail I think in my area the average age is late twenties or early thirties That said retail is not a great career path It can take years to become a SM or DM and there arent a lot of DM jobs to begin with While the DM wage is decent lifetime earnings will be lower if you worked your way up You can go to college and earn more than DMs out of school at 21 There are plenty of wellpaying jobs that dont involve sitting at a desk all day You got to hustle and invest in yourself to find a career thatll help achieve your goals If Starbucks isnt getting you there perhaps its time to move on,-8.0,2020-09-16 04:17:03,26.0,0.044,0.919,0.038,-0.2537

You get it Its not so much a wage issue its a cost of living issue And it needs to be addressed everywhere Even if starbucks said here is 20 an hour and then other fast food restaurants followed suit it wouldnt matter because cost of living would just go up and youd be right back where you started,1.0,2020-09-16 10:05:08,26.0,0.019,0.981,0.0,-0.0191

It has been documented and witnessed that people are eating cats and dogs in Venezuela South Korea has outlawed pets and forcing people to turn them in as a food source because everyone is starving and keeping pets is considered a luxury And how is California succeeding Super high crime rate super high taxes and a large amount of California residents actually fled the states mostly due to the tax rate so yeah their doing peachy,1.0,2020-09-16 16:05:11,26.0,0.072,0.769,0.159,0.8208

At my old store this wouldnt fly You need to communicate most everything It is your job to focus on the bar if you are on bar Its their job to watch their own shit Were they in the back together,5.0,2020-09-16 16:27:42,36.0,0.083,0.917,0.0,-0.5574
There are times during close when you might be expected to take drive thru orders and make them at the same time like if the shift is in back counting drawers and the other person might be trying to finish up dishes or something like that but its not okay to just leave you out there like that without telling you what is going on Usually whoever is in back will keep the headset on and you just call them up if you get a rush you cant handle alone Im sure the girl didnt realize you are new and hadnt done this before and was expecting you to tell her you needed her to come help but she also should have let you know before leaving the floor,5.0,2020-09-16 16:55:43,36.0,0.024,0.865,0.111,0.9014

Poor communication from your partners for sure but they were probably both in the back so your SSV could do money counts and the other partner could finish up dishes not to good off It sucks but its just how closing is since they dont give us enough people Soloing drive is super scary and frustrating when it gets busy so I feel you there It makes you a stronger barista though learning how to manage doing all 3 roles at once warming makes you way more efficient when youre planted in just one role or doing DTOWindow so its not all bad they just should have communicated and prepared you better,2.0,2020-09-16 19:21:45,36.0,0.119,0.691,0.19,0.8707

If youre working in a drive thru at least one of your coworkers should have been wearing a headset Use it Rather than waiting five minutes and yelling why are you alone hit that button and tell them that you need help There are legitimate reasons for you to be the only one on the floor and unless theyre staring at the security camera screens your coworkers are not going to know if you need help Thats why your coworker told you to calm down because there was a step between being alone and yelling like you did Communication goes both ways and it sounds like you didnt ask for help until you were already past a breaking point,1.0,2020-09-17 00:09:00,36.0,0.031,0.829,0.139,0.9153

Yeah Im thinking there was a lot of misunderstanding all around I get why we have to drop down to less people but it makes everything so much more stressful sometimes At this point Im only just now getting decent at running the window and third by myself so adding drinks when Im not super confident or fast on top of that kind of sent me over the edge Ive been here 6 months and Im beginning to feel like everyone expects me to be bettermore experienced than I actually am right now The reality is Ive spent most of my time at window3rd and foodfront And thats pretty much it,3.0,2020-09-16 17:21:43,36.0,0.13,0.779,0.09,-0.7224

this explains why i chose the job my current store is just overall poorly managed I am a barista handling shift duties and am very capable of being a shift yet the manager claims we are at capacity even though we just had a shift quit One of the shifts at my store is extremely petty and big headed and acts as if hes the store manager even though he cant even do the order correctly The night block for Monday Wednesday Friday and Sundays is usually over staffed yet my closing crew has 4 people from usually from 39pm so we usually only are able to take our 30s during an 8 hour shift This Saturday me and my team mate clocked out for our 30s but kept working because we were not about to just leave the other people hanging its extremely ridiculous and no matter how much we complain nothing ever changes so were just going to transfer as a group to a new drive thru store thats opening up near us SORRY FOR THE LONG COMMENT I JUST NEEDED TO GET IT OFF MY CHEST THANKS IF YOU READ IT,2.0,2020-09-15 09:35:30,69.0,0.088,0.872,0.04,-0.8144

The 3rd place rules were updated a little over a month ago Customers are now 100 accountable for their own behavior demeanor and must follow local health mandates Otherwise you can refuse service Basically you can offer them a mask to wait outside for their order or you can point them to a drive thru If they make any sort of scene or start using profanity you can refuse service and file an incident report,16.0,2020-09-16 01:07:59,70.0,0.06,0.94,0.0,-0.5267

I get what youre saying but whether or not men are actively using their height or build as a means of intimidation they have to acknowledge that its there and people will still be intimidated by it I dont know how an interaction is going to go when I tell people to put masks on but if theyre larger than me it makes it more difficult to be okay with telling them to do something because I know that if things were to get physical then Id be out of luck This applies in general to society but yeah,3.0,2020-09-16 06:00:03,70.0,0.125,0.792,0.083,-0.6739

Im a SSV Our manager has been very vocal about how they think COVID is being way overblown and its all ridiculous That made partners feel uncomfortable and that their worries werent going to be taken seriously So 1 watch what you say around your team and make sure they feel comfortable being honest with you Also they take everything personally Someone calls in sick Instant bad mood and its taken out of everyone on the floor Someone puts in their two weeks She gives them the cold shoulder and doesnt ask why So 2 dont make yourself the focus If you stay calm so will they Basically we have a huge problem at our store because everyone is scared of our manager because she will flip out at the smallest thing When peak hits its not how can we help the customer its what does the manager need Everyone caters to her A great manager is one that supports their team not the other way around The fact that youre asking this shows you care and I think youll do great,7.0,2020-09-16 06:26:08,76.0,0.105,0.752,0.143,0.8442

Best advice if your goal is to enhance the Partner experience is to keep their biggest challenges in mind Regardless if management or location of your store each and every one of your Partners is underpaid and working in stores with nowhere near enough labor to support the ever growing expectations from the company Keep the above in mind with every conversation you have with Partners and especially when you have to coach for tasks not getting done Youll do just fine,3.0,2020-09-16 06:09:38,76.0,0.0,0.868,0.132,0.8658
Communication Make sure youre taking time to touch base with your shifts and see what kinds of experiences they and the baristas are going through so you have an understanding of what store morale is likesomething thats very important in the current climate Also make sure that if a shift isnt able to come to a shift meeting that you take the time to connect with them and relay info from the shift meeting instead of them having to get the info from the other shifts,2.0,2020-09-16 10:40:47,76.0,0.0,0.924,0.076,0.6901
I think communication and listening is most important from my leader Sometimes I just need you to listen to me whine about how annoying something is Sometimes I need you to listen to me when I tell you that this person isnt a great fit for us and these are the reasons why Also just telling people whats going on in the store helps keep them more involved and makes you feel like youre part of things Things that are detrimental for me is feeling like my SM doesnt care if I struggle or appreciate me I know we are all over worked and underpaid but all that is a little less crappy when my SM regularly tells me that he thinks Im doing a great job and that he appreciates my efforts in the store also he always says call me if you need anything as hes leaving Its kind of obvious and maybe a little insincere since he always says it but also I kind of love it because it means that even if he isnt in the store with me hes still got my back Also writing great schedules super helps Plus finding coverage when call outs happen is awesome Fixing my problems before they are my problems Yes please Also just little things Someone was an hour late to their shift it was the middle of peak and I was on drive bar on admin day Instead of letting everything struggledie my SM stopped admin work for 2 minutes to check my late partner in so we could keep pushing drinks out He didnt have to it oh man did that little action help so much,2.0,2020-09-16 15:59:57,76.0,0.109,0.75,0.141,0.889

With a properly functioning windscreen turned on which is a requirement nonetheless Enough pressure is pushed out that window that its going to be near impossible for any droplets to make it into the building This has been posted by Starbucks and many of the major Healthy and Safety organizations You are more likely to pass droplets to them as the pressure goes out and down Even without the windscreen on The passive airflow in the building and the opening of your front entrance should still create a significant draft out Face shields are allowed already and will be available to order in October for DTW partners As for anybody who gets snow Your window will be closed with the heater on in just a few weeks So its one less thing you dont have to worry about The face shield will be the same protection as a plexiglass partition The only real areas of contact are moneydebitcredit terminal and handing out product Terminal can be cleaned after each use if they dont have Tap with single use Red Sani Cloths typical in Clover stores or you are allowed to have a bin the same that goes under your espresso bar with sani solution and a cloth Just make sure its not soaked or you will fry the terminals screen security lock Hand sanitizer should be there for change And you can use any wire basket to hand items out if you dont want to physically hold them,5.0,2020-09-16 11:23:44,77.0,0.022,0.874,0.104,0.9606

Its a public health and safety violation If its 15 to 35 and with a windchill hitting almost 45 degrees Celsius We are allowed to close the window This was in a communication at some point over the last 3 years Most drivers already roll their windows back up Its a loss of heat for your store It could hurt your DTW person since they cant have gloves which also means rotating positions need to be much more frequent It was also suggested to keep it open Yes But not that it had to be for indoor seating it becomes unbearably cold Same with partners And if I have to go do my own warming or my own CloverPour over turn around to make iced drinks Im going to be closing that window There is zero rule that states it has to be left open So what if you lose some connection stores Earn them back on nailing a perfect speaker box order taking going fast efficient and giving out the right drinks Seal the deal when you hand everything off to them Of course you can still talk if you want but its not required Your health is more important Especially when it comes to frost bite Fight the bottles that count Im sure a face shield and a plexiglass will fog up wonderfully with a required mask to still be worn under it Explain the situation to your SM and DM Talk with PCC Yes try and engage when you can But Id thats not possible Close the window It makes it better for everybody else Having an SM on your side is far more beneficial,3.0,2020-09-16 11:53:19,77.0,0.047,0.821,0.133,0.975

If this is something you want to try just because it might seem cool and just want spending money then Id say now is no the time Its getting colder and pandemic precautions seem to just be getting laxer Starbucks prioritizes speed over safety The safety measures in place are superficial without really protecting the partners and only hinders us Its a job where you interact with hundreds and hundreds of customers a day And there is no guarantee that your store work environment wont be a toxic pit So is it worth it just for fun and cash Nah The only reason some of my coworkers are staying is because they are in desperate need to pay rent and tuition and insurance If you can land something that pays higher and with less exposure to the public go for that instead,5.0,2020-09-16 13:08:07,78.0,0.062,0.821,0.117,0.8158

Starbucks has an ethics statement that you can access from the partner hub that lays out the ethical standards they hold their suppliers to Since we cant post internal documents Ill describe the steps to get there Log into the Partner Hub On the main page under one of the submenus there is a section about Ethical Sourcing Click on the one that reads Manufactured Goods In the section entitled What Are Our Standards there is a PDF Click on that That takes you to a 4page document entitled Starbucks Supplier Social Responsibility Standards Manufactured Goods and Services TBH as someone who has a deep knowledge of the prison system of the United States I found the language a little unsettling and squirrelly especially around the issue of prison labor Starbucks has used US prison labor in the past to produce holiday items and when asked about it today defaults to the language in this document that Starbucks will not tolerate the use of any forced or involuntary labor either directly or indirectly by our suppliers contractors or subcontractors This includes the use of slave labor bonded labor indentured labor or involuntary convict labor But the problem is that most jobs in jails and prisons while voluntary on paper are highly coerced In many you are required to hold a job and are punished if you dont And even the ones where its isnt strictly required if you choose not to take one you are disproportionately targeted for abuse and harassment by COs Your stay is harder You dont earn as much good time credit Holding a job in prison is seen as a sign of reform and responsibility at parole hearings not holding one is seen almost as if the person is just one step away from falling right back into a life of crime My point is you cant truly call prison labor voluntary And I think Starbucks knows that And my gut tells me they still use prison labor but its okay because the inmates said they were cool with it guys right That makes it okay Its a special job that paid a few more dollars and got the prisoners a few extra perks So they had them sign an NDA and a contract saying they were voluntary signing up for this job and added then word involuntary before prison labor because corporatespeak,7.0,2020-09-16 15:10:17,92.0,0.099,0.839,0.062,-0.9253
Well theyre partnered with Nestle which is well known for relying on child labor among other heinous business practices Ive read a couple places that a lot of the whole bean packaging in the US is done by prisoners but I cant remember where exactly And I have no proof of this at all but Ive suspected for a long time that they use prison call centers to staff the facilities contact center I cant put my finger on it but after being a shift for over 10 years my gut just tells me every time I have to call the FCC that the women Im talking to are in a prison call center job,1.0,2020-09-16 16:37:14,92.0,0.137,0.837,0.026,-0.9337

This is a really good starting point in terms of looking for red flags and you certainly found one But honestly the problem doesnt have an easy solution The question does Starbucks use ethical labor can only be answered one of two ways 1 Finding proof that they use unethical labor at any given point in the supply chain 2 Examining each and every step of the supply chain for every single product Obviously given the scale and complexity of the Starbucks operation 2 isnt viable Which means were essentially left trying to prove a negative Personally I find a policy document entirely inadequate to prove anything Thats just their official stance To develop confidence that this policy is being upheld I think wed need to look for the internal checking processes and enforcement methods,1.0,2020-09-16 16:53:22,92.0,0.102,0.781,0.118,0.3387

Having also worked both I understand that mornings have more sales than evenings however those extra partners on the floor make a world of difference versus closes It could just be my location but the difference of sales does not justify having 16 the amount of people on the floor especially when the SSV often has duties to attend to in the back There should be no point where a store has a drivethru line wrapped around the building and for a nighttime skeleton crew to be expected to deal with such high sales volumes relative to number of baristas as well as stocking and prep I believe some frustration is valid This is especially true when the majority of the morning shift at my location is not understanding at all and thinks all the closers are just lazy college students,6.0,2020-09-15 15:31:17,94.0,0.069,0.875,0.056,-0.4516

you know i dont understand some commentsposts that accuse so many of us of being ungrateful I am so grateful to have a job when i got back from my leave i was genuinely touched and it made my day that so many of my regulars missed me i dont take their kindness for granted however i feel like its the companys goal to like gaslight us into only being grateful because we get told we have enough labor when we dont we get told were being safe when cleanliness isnt a priority and maybe its not at all stores and i do my best to make the right things a priority on my shifts but i cant do anything about other peoples shifts or about the culture that is encouraged by upper management idk hope you get what i mean im grateful to have a job im grateful for my regulars but i think we should hold the company accountable for gaslighting us and for the lack of communication and for the culture it seems to nurture in so many of its stores,8.0,2020-09-15 23:05:22,109.0,0.063,0.769,0.168,0.9703

Its not that bad since people order the pumpkin cold brew so often I can blend two drinks worth when its busy and not waste much Theres stabilizers in the pumpkin sauce and the sweet cream from the heavy cream so the foam holds for a long time I usually get a grande pumpkin cream cold brew sub 1 pump chai Fewer calories and more caffeine plus it tastes sweeter than with vanilla,1.0,2020-09-15 06:17:26,142.0,0.0,0.864,0.136,0.8435

Id like to add that I am just a customer I worked for Starbucks for years at a very busy Chicago location about 20 years agobut regardless it sucks seeing this and all the reactions from baristas about the pumpkin cold foam Everything sucks now Ive lost loved ones to COVID I live in an area that is full of civil unrest and riddled with senseless violence and I also am and have been a commuteressential worker throughout this entire pandemic Very few things bring me joy lately but one small indulgence that I truly look forward to is my grande pumpkin cream cold brew It sucks knowing it was probably made with contempt No one wants or needs that energy Especially now man I appreciate all my Starbucks folks do for me and others and I know the endless lines of people and changing menu items are frustrating but please know that you are making one persons day just a little bit better I dont want to feel guilty for ordering a drink I sincerely enjoy that isnt available yearround because the baristas hate making it and if it sucks making it that bad quit your job and find something that makes you less miserable I know several people that are looking for work and would love an opportunity to work for Starbucks Or anywhere for that matter,-1.0,2020-09-15 04:03:39,142.0,0.163,0.682,0.155,-0.2994

Technically anything is possible But When you put the cold foam on a hot drink it melts super quick and then becomes a potential environment for harmful bacteria Plus Sweet cream taste wise is basically uncharged whipped cream so for a hot beverage you would be better off getting the free of charge whip than the dollar or so cold foam thats gon na disappear almost immediately and can cause potential tummy troubles later,8.0,2020-09-14 15:23:31,142.0,0.058,0.752,0.19,0.9062
Short answer is yes Long answer is you can get it on a hot drink but it will melt almost immediately and you will be asked by every person that reads your sticker if your drink supposed to be cold just to make sure we arent making it wrong,5.0,2020-09-15 00:31:30,142.0,0.0,0.847,0.153,0.7981

I blame Starbucks convoluted system of drink orderingbuilding Is it a latte with extra shots and milk upcharge or specific number shots of espresso with steamed condiment or Espresso Macchiato and milk upcharge or a Cappuccino with extra shots and milk upcharge and light foam or perhaps even an Americano with extra shots and no water sub half and half So decide Real quick But in a way most advantageous to all considered With minimum training while smiling and standing on one foot and spinning all the plates,42.0,2020-09-15 06:27:57,145.0,0.051,0.871,0.078,0.3597
To be fair if the customer is putting 6 shots in a short cup there is not enough room left for the milk to get charged for it Thats why he usually pays less They charge him just for the shots because we give 4oz of milk for free,46.0,2020-09-15 03:42:36,145.0,0.035,0.856,0.109,0.5859
Best practice would be to ring up a drink the way its ordered Thats been the general response of my former DMs and SMs Its not worth the time loss to argue over it The company will still make a large profit from it and the potential loss is accounted for The only time this doesnt apply that I can think of is water hacks where they ask for water plus syrup Thats a custom iced tea,7.0,2020-09-15 09:53:26,145.0,0.105,0.81,0.086,0.1114

This is such a gray area I wouldve done what you did tho and charge for a latte most likely I also base a lot of my grayarea decisions on how nice the customer was to me and my staff If they were rude most likely I wont care and charge whatever I thought was right If they were nice I wouldve gone out of my way to make it the experience as best as possible and look for cheaper alternatives Also I wouldve explained to them why the confusion,0.0,2020-09-15 08:41:28,145.0,0.087,0.807,0.105,0.4036

Yeah no when a double shot on ice is sitting for a few minutes the foam sinks and goes away The only coffee in that drink is the espresso Dont worry this happens all the time customers dont actually know what theyre ordering Theres no way to add coffee to that drink unless you add espresso or more milk so you were right,24.0,2020-09-15 10:39:23,155.0,0.067,0.864,0.07,0.0531

One way to remove the gap without going past the splash amount of 2 milk using the following methodology Pull shots into shot glass Pump required number of shots into shaker add correct volumetric scoop of ice sequence out to next drink if necessary Pour shots into shaker shake The hot espresso will melt some ice but you will still be short on liquid despite the foam appearing to make it full the gap Pour contents into customers cup Fill cup with more ice through the foam until you can see the new ice level with the rim of cup Add the splash of 2 milk The splash will fill between the ice and squish some foam while ultimately filling to the top of the cup As the drink sits for the mobile customer the ice will melt a bit further into liquid water form and the foam will dissipate However the liquid level near the top of the cup will be maintained so you can leave the drink No more gap,4.0,2020-09-15 16:21:23,155.0,0.033,0.927,0.039,0.0011

I know for me I typically just assume if they want a a certain syrup like vanilla in their ice coffee they dont want classic unless further specified But its one of those things thats different for everyone I guess my thought process is just that adding full pumps of the syrup PLUS full pumps of classic would be overly sweet for just about anyone but working for Starbucks for the past two years nothing surprises me anymore Lol,2.0,2020-09-15 18:54:08,160.0,0.025,0.834,0.141,0.7431

Press Ristretto or Long if you need those sorts of shots then the number of shots you want Ristretto shots only pull in twos so if you do something like a grande flat white the second set of shots will need the cup moved over to only catch half the espresso Mastrena 1s got a handle for the steam wand so pull that all the way down for automatic steaming about halfway for manual steaming and theres a and button on the display if you need the milk steamed extra hot or warm Mastrena 1s only have two hoppers so there will be a decaf machine and the other one will be for blonde Both can also pull regular espresso On the blonde machine youll hit the decaf button for shots because the blonde beans go in the decaf hopper If your shots pull too slow theres a knob to adjust grind It should Tell you when you need to do it Pull three sets of double shots after turning the knob to give it time to calibrate If you have any questions just ask Im off work in a couple of hours so I can answer more then Got ta hop back on the floor,10.0,2020-09-15 10:08:31,161.0,0.0,0.965,0.035,0.6124

Till audits will be coming Man it sounds like your manager wasnt doing their job and got chewed out by their dm during a recent ppv visit where they looked at the pl and discovered a larger discrepancy in cash shortage than usual Your manager wont be able to do retroactive till audits But I imagine the statement was meant more so as a going forward type of statement though the reality is that they should have been doing this all along as it has been pointed out at least twice a week But yeah it just takes time building the habit of logging out of your till when going on break or leaving for the day but thats really all you need to do As long as you havent been mismanaging money then you dont have anything to worry about They do also have cameras pointed at every single register Ive seen a few partners get separated for stealing money sometimes not even on their own till and in each instance Starbucks made sure to go through the camera footage so they knew since that way that partner couldnt come back and say well my manager just counted wrong and didnt do the audit correctly or something like that,3.0,2020-09-15 14:42:03,163.0,0.066,0.879,0.055,-0.6542
A till audit happens whenever an SM counts down a till SMs are supposed to do at least 2 per week to check to make sure everyone is being accurate with money and ringing things up As long as the till is within 5 or 5 then everything is ok So long as there isnt a pattern of consistently being short 5 Protect yourself make sure you lock your till whenever you step away even briefly If someone insists that you share your till you can and should refuse and report that to the SM or partner resources Never ring on someone elses till Official policy is still no till sharing if business is slow you may only be using the left or the right side but you can still use both the top and bottom to avoid sharing,2.0,2020-09-15 14:07:55,163.0,0.042,0.846,0.113,0.7964

There is nothing you can do directly to incentivise the company simply doesnt give us the resources to do that outside of the occasional couple large pizzas after a decent DT week But what you can do is offer support and coaching Ask whats on their mind Find out what is important to them about this job and what obstacles they are facing during their shifts Sometimes just talking these problems out is a help already but often this discourse can help the team brainstorm solutions together rather than waiting for your leaders to fix it Youll also find that affirmation and support in the moment can also be very impactful on the Partner experience in that shift Hey uwkuta bud you are killing it on bar today youve stayed in routine and managed to keep the area clean Im impressed What can I do to help you keep it up,5.0,2020-09-15 11:05:24,169.0,0.057,0.794,0.149,0.9294
Not to be a downer but theres really nothing you can do Were being worked to the bone more and more is being demanded of us while we feel less and less valued as employees Even SMs arent really going to be able to drive up partner motivation when whats killing us is too little staffing too little pay too little protection You arent going to be able to fix those things Just be genuine be kind be understanding If youre asking how to get partners to motivate each other I recommend not doing that Were all doing enough emotional labor for ourselves and our families Dont ask people to be responsible for each other at work as well Most of us no longer have the ability were all basically in survival mode,3.0,2020-09-16 04:36:58,169.0,0.083,0.742,0.175,0.9276

I can see why you wouldnt think so which is why I blame the company and not the customers for not wearing masks The truth is though that were within six feet of each other at the drive through window Being outside as opposed to inside doesnt matter within six feet it only matters when social distancing because there is less airflow and therefore more risk to be in a closed space with other people We would all super appreciate it if you wore masks Being exposed to so many people at the window who are not wearing masks is a little scary to be honest But again we dont blame you If we were allowed by the company to request that people wear masks at the window no one would forget to,28.0,2020-09-14 05:23:52,172.0,0.114,0.795,0.091,-0.0706

Tell them that there shouldnt be an up charge for soy If they seem confused tell them that since its less than four ounces of milk they should click the with soy button on the right side of the screen After being a barista and getting charged for almond milk in my coffee all of the time explaining fully is the only way I usually get them to understand Its super frustrating Ive had stores where literally no one was taught how to charge the soy or not Ive just started mobile ordering instead to avoid it,10.0,2020-09-15 07:04:43,175.0,0.109,0.853,0.037,-0.6705
Unfortunately theres a lot of confusion about this drink My own store manager is 100 convinced that theres an upcharge for getting it with a nondairy which has caused quite a few awkward situations with customers I dont think its Kareny to nicely point it out because youre right but I dont know what would help other than trying a different store or mobile ordering more often,5.0,2020-09-15 10:15:59,175.0,0.071,0.82,0.11,0.559

At first when I read this I was like duh you get charged then moments later I realized youre right its less than 4 Oz so no charge I think the problem is that the dairy is automatically selected on the left charging side so if someone just picks soy on the dairy side like they normally would for like a latte it charges them The suggestion to mobile order and pick it up is a good one tho,1.0,2020-09-16 17:09:28,175.0,0.113,0.763,0.124,0.2344

1 Questions about what you know about Starbucks and the founder Usually tell me about a time questions where you had to deal with a conflict at work you provided exceptional customer service for this you can use an example from your job and just state you were serving an internal customer like your boss or the theatre customers or use your problem solving skills Hypotheticals like how would you handle an angry customer apologize ask what you can do to make the moment right remake the drink or offer to treat them to their next one with a recovery card or a really busy store focus on maintaining standards while working quickly to minimize the wait thank customers for their patience and use their long wait times to make customer connectionsyou can also emphasize that you are calm under pressure and enjoy the energy of a busy workplace 2 One of the best ways to show youre good for customer service is just through your personality and demeanour Smile be friendly to everyone eg when you show up and let the barista at the register know youre here for an interview start with Hi how are you etc You can state that you are looking for something customerfacing because you enjoy interacting with people and making their day brighter with a special drink Something about how Starbucks is known for going above and beyond to make our guests feel welcome and it means a lot to you that everyone who comes in leaves feeling happier than they were before Stuff like that 3 Black pants and a buttondown shirt maybe with a sweater over it if the weather permits That always looks nice without looking too dressy Try to spend some time practicing your answers to common questions like I listed above so you arent caught offguard Mostly just relax and be positive they arent looking for tons of experience just a good attitude and someone who seems willing to learn Good luck,2.0,2020-09-15 08:49:45,192.0,0.028,0.774,0.198,0.9954
Be outgoing and show them that you are a people person Use your theater experience to emphasize how well you are at teamworksupporting other coworkers to get the job done Let them know you consider yourself a leader and are reliable If asked why you want to work for Starbucks tell them youve heard the company provides great benefits helps develop skills for promotions and that you enjoy the coffeehouse experience that Starbucks provides to its community Both my hiring interview and promotion interview have been super relaxed and chill No need to be nervous Also you dont need any coffee experience or knowledge prior to getting hired so dont lie lol,1.0,2020-09-15 12:09:58,192.0,0.053,0.753,0.194,0.9539

In this situation just use the APRON model with your partners It really helps clear the air at work and in your personal time because now you wrote out an entire post for it when you could have been doing something else youd like possibly Also be aware that as a partner your taken care of pretty well Talk to your SM about therapy mental support is big with starbucks but partners never try it The company will give you 6 free sessions Good luck with your coffee journey and remember its just coffee at the end of the day let most incidents and situations be like water and let it roll off your back,1.0,2020-09-15 07:13:53,196.0,0.0,0.78,0.22,0.9771
