"Hi partners, checking in here from my doctor ordered quarantine. I was exposed to COVID-19, and roughly ten days later started becoming symptomatic. To keep it simple, I feel like garbage. I will never taking breathing for granted again. 

But to why I’m commenting here:

The 30 days leave is great. It’s a really cool step forward, once the details are ironed out. I know my SM checked in to let me know my 14 day catastrophe pay was approved, but she has zero information about the 30 days leave. She’s waiting on information from our DM. They found out when we did, which blows. 

BUT BUT BUT

P L E A S E, if you take it, STAY INSIDE. This isn’t a 30 day vacation, it’s a safety precaution. This isn’t the time to be gathering in bars (if they’re even open), or to have parties. Stay home and stay safe. Order delivery if you can, contactless if there’s an option, and tip well. I know my friends who do deliveries can’t stop, and they’re relying on these tips. Keep social distancing. Flatten the curve. We don’t know what a week from now or a month from now will look like, but we can do our part now. Flatten the damn curve, stay hydrated, and I’ll see you on the other side.",80.0,2020-03-22 07:27:09,0.0,pos,0.518725464043688,0.4812745359563027

"Ok nice to see that Starbucks is a global shit show. Here's what happened today in my store in Germany, you can't make this shit up. 

On Friday evening, my state announced that all restaurants will be closed due to Covid-19. A couple of days earlier, Amrest sent out a FAQ mail which clearly stated that Starbucks is considered a restaurant. There was a point before that, where it wasn't clear if the Bux was considered retail or food service industry, and it was important to know because of the frequently updated bans and shutdowns made by the state. I met up today with my SM and another barista to take inventory and prep the store to close for the unforeseeable future, when around 11 am we got a call that other coffee chains were still open downtown and we had about an hour to open ours again, too. I don't know if it's a legit loophole but Amrest claims that since we're only doing take-out (came in effect only today lol), we're not a regular restaurant and therefore allowed to operate.

That the Bux doesn't care isn't anything new, we should've closed a while ago not only for the customers safety but *for ours* too. But the couple hours where it was announced that we're closed and Amrest wants to ensure 90% of payment instead of 60% were a real pleasant surprise. I really feel like BooBoo The Fool ™ for believing that they actually care lol As soon as it was known that others were still open and the Bux can have a slice of that money cake, they grabbed that opportunity and flipped us off. Now other SM's are telling us to be reasonable and grateful that we still have a job?! I'm sorry Ma'am, but that sounds fucked up. We're dealing with a pandemic.",13.0,2020-03-22 10:43:10,0.0,pos,0.99970584699738,0.00029415300263043197

UPDATE! I’m a shift supervisor at Starbucks and have worked there for about a year and a half. I requested to take the 30 days off. My reasoning was that I am a clarinet major in college and the virus attacks the lungs. If the virus were to damage my lungs permanently I would have to change career paths. I know it’s not a super intense reason but it was my reasoning. Corporate claimed I didn’t meet a required standard and therefore would NOT be paid for my 30 days off but I could still choose to not work for 30 days. I of course asked what the standards were and my manager responded saying even she didn’t know the standards. Don’t expect to get paid everyone.

"So, as far as I know only one person at my store has taken any sort of time off due to illness. As nice as it is that we have the option to not come in, no one is taking it because no one wants to screw over the rest of the people who aren't and no one wants to be the one person that means we don't have enough coverage and will have to close.

"Yes, I am incredibly thankful for the 1 month+ of paid time at home. Yes, I'm incredibly thankful for the extra $3/hour through may. I'm very thankful that I still have my job, and that my company is trying. But this doesn't mean that my not-so-happy feelings about Starbucks are invalid.

We are officially back to work on May 4th, I believe we are open to the public on the 5th. I love my bosses, I love my fellow shifts, I love my baristas, and I am so broken up about us going back to work so soon. While we will be DT-only, wearing masks, etc., but COVID-19 hasn't even peaked in our state yet. While it was amazing to have that month of social distancing that surely helped a lot of people, but the surge of COVID-19 in our area is predicted in mid-May, or even mid-June.

In our state and county, Starbucks meets the criteria for essential businesses, so we can legally be open. Social distancing and stay at home measures are not being enforced. Our numbers looked better when there was enough fear to keep people at home, but earlier in the month, many people decided that the risk was low enough that they could resume life as normal, which is, of course, putting themselves and everyone else at high risk.

So, what happens when COVID-19 inevitably hits our community, hard, and \~35 of us are still coming into contact daily with each other and with the public? How many of us will get sick? I know that I can use my sick and vacation time, but it's not like I have months saved up, only a few days. I know that I can apply for a leave of absence, but I can't not get paid. I don't qualify for the stimulus check. I know that, at the end of the day, Starbucks is a business that has to be open to function. But at what cost? We have already used our one month, and the worst is yet to come. Will they let us close again, or do we just have to suck it up?

I'm scared for me, I'm scared for my coworkers and my community. I've thought about writing a letter to corporate, but what can I even say? It's not like I have a solution, either. I guess, if nothing else, this qualifies as a rant/cry for help. Even if you can only commiserate, I appreciate any input I can get. I'm just feeling dejected and disheartened.

"my SM decided to close our DT store!

don't get me wrong, this company is making me sick with how poorly they've handled this. but some managers are doing their part. my SM called to tell me that she's made the decision to shut down our store and offered me the 30 days of pay. i obviously took it--i'll be fine even if i get sick, and my roommate is in the same boat. i'm much more concerned about our older regulars who started coming through the drive-thru after closing our cafe. and i'm upset about the customers treating our store like a restaurant because it's the only thing that's open. i'm tired of giving ""medicine balls"" to customers who cough and sneeze all over their handfuls of change before paying.

i recognize that i very well might be in the minority as a closed DT store, and i'm so stupidly fortunate. but i'm sending good vibes to every one of you who still has to come to work. we can't forget how corporate chose to treat us during a pandemic even when it's over.

"My store is one of the last few open Starbucks in the area (we are cafe + DT so our DT was still open).

My SM is very obviously confused and taken aback by all of this and is trying to get it all figured out, but he has said that he is trying his best to figure out what all this stuff is corporate dumped on us. Until then he said we are gonna remain open but if anyone feels uncomfortable he will honor any requests to stay home.

THAT BEING SAID

Everyone at work today was awesome. We were pretty busy but customers were being so nice! Everyone was thanking us profusely for being open and almost every other customer gave us a tip. Someone even gave us a $10! We got pizza, danced, and generally had a good time.

One of my shifts told me right now to not take the 30 days because my SM is still trying to make sense of this confusing situation, which I get honestly and it seemed like my shift was looking out for me bc she said that after the 30 days who knows what Starbucks will do next, so she said to reserve it until we close down? She also said our store is likely gonna be closing soon (within a few weeks). But I’m still worried and every day I still feel scared going to work :/

If there’s anything to learn through all of this is that IT’S GONNA BE OKAY. We’re all going to get through this. If you guys don’t feel safe then STAY HOME.

"I don't think there is enough proper options provided by Starbucks for those with underlying conditions. My DM and SM pretty much said unpaid leave, or we can just separate from employment. The shifts at my Starbucks don't take precautions seriously, and to keep myself safe, I had to take the cat pay. People wouldn't be washing hands or sanitizing properly, etc. 

Not to mention, Starbucks isn't essential and we can't properly social distance even if we wanted to. With CS and support having to move in and out of areas, and the cramped bar, partners are constantly crossing paths long enough that they could be asymptomatic and spreading the illness. Also the fact that they go from one area and touch that surface, to another to touch another surface. Take into account if anyone doesn't properly sanitize, and it's a recipe for an outbreak. 

I know SB stand on nurturing the community. I know that a lot of truly essential workers (nurses, first responders, etc.) rely on their daily cup of coffee. And I'm glad SB is standing up to the company slogan. But given our job and how cramped they make the stores (which is a whole other complaint I have.)

"As if Starbucks wasn't already bad and degrading enough to work for.

THEY ARE OKAY WITH US DYING FOR SOME BOURGEOISIE KAREN'S FRAPPUCINO!

We are given inadequate '''PPE''' that can't protect against anything, doesn't even form a seal against the face, and is basically as effective as doing nothing. The only thing it DOES do is work like a surgical mask to keep our germs in and protect the customers, the only people corporate \*does\* care about, while leaving us exposed.

We, like everyone else, have had dumb customer come in to get mobile orders. They touch us when we pass them drinks, they've even *lowered their masks* to ask questions about the app or complain about orders.

THIS IS WHY WE NEED A UNION!

If we had an organization by **us** for **us** with access to corporate information and the ability to check corporate decisions, such as whatever process they used to inform their PPE policies, sure as hell didn't involve consulting anyone with knowledge of PPE, and advocate for ourselves.

We can refuse to work, we can tear the profits right out of their greedy, money-grubbing hands. We can stop operating equipment, refuse to fill orders, shut shit down, picket workplaces, physically bar new hires and interviews from entering the venue during the time in which we'd be scheduled to be on shift. We need to start looking at union tactics and deploying them again, because those corporate swine have had their boots on our necks for too long and it's about time we grabbed that boot, twisted the ankle in it, shoved the person it belongs to the ground, and smash them until they listen.

"How did your stores react to the 30 days PTO news?


My partners and I almost all consider each other friends. We have a group chat where we talk just for fun pretty much. When we all received the notification about the possibility of 30 days of pay, we all hopped on a group call and talked for almost two hours. Almost all of us lived with high risk family members and dreaded going to work. This opportunity was what we had been waiting for. At first there was confusion in the call, “what does this mean?” “How does this work?” “Huh?” Then it was “should we ask our manager right now?” 

To avoid flooding our manager with the same question, one of us contacted him about the notification. He responded saying he would be having a conference call at 9:30 pm, and would get back to us when it finished up. Together we decided to at least let him know that we all were interested pending the details. Once our manager got out of his conference call he texted us one by one. 

He told us we can start our 30 days tomorrow (Saturday at the time), Sunday, or Monday. We sat there for about an hour deciding what our next move would be. When would our last day be for the betterment of our store, and to ensure no one feels abandoned. We contacted the manager with the proposal to move clean play up to Saturday, to ensure it gets done this week, and most decided Sunday would be our last day. 

I feel fortunate that my partners and I worked through the somewhat confusing two hours together and came up with a good game plan. I’m a bit sad though to see other partners have had nowhere near the same experience. Some even feel guilty for taking the time off. Is my store just weird in that we all said yes to this PTO? I don’t think anyone should feel guilty for taking this opportunity.

"Customer here... not sure what else to do, but figured I'd ask here (even though this isn't he most active of threads).

I go to my local drive-thru about 1-2x a week, and have since about April or so to support local business (even though it's a chain, of course, but jobs are jobs!)  The last 3 weeks, there has been a girl on bar who consistently has worn her mask under her nose.  I chose to avoid that store for awhile, but went back today... and finally said this to the worker at the window:  ""Your coworker really needs to wear her mask over her nose.""  Not in a bitchy tone, either, just concerned.  I was rudely cut off with an ""OK, thank you"" and she turned away. (ETA:  for all I know, she may have just as pissed about her coworker, too, and is tired of having to deal with it)

Early on in the pandemic, the manager had put a hand-written sign on the window to contact her directly with questions/comments about the store with her number, which I found rather weird, but whatever.  Today I kinda wished that sign was up.  :/

It's just not a fair/kind/safe thing for this worker to do, especially since all of her coworkers \*are\* following protocol... plus, there is a sign posted on the window requiring all patrons to wear a mask, even though this is strictly a walk-up/drive-thru location (and I always always always do, even in drive-thru, out of respect for the workers and zero trust for the car ahead of me, ha).

Anyway, I did leave a comment on the website, but not sure if there's anything else I should do?  I have zero interest in raising a stink, but come on... it's a global pandemic. There are enough stories on r/covidpositive to know that it doesn't take much for someone to get infected.

"Hi guys so I felt ill with cough, runny nose, sore throat, and a bit of a temp. I went to my local hospital and they diagnosed me with bronchitis and a sinus infection. However today I had trouble breathing so I went up to Charleston and had a COVID- 19 test and saw another physician and a really good PA and Nurse. 

No lie I’m scared. This year wasn’t supposed to go like this. I was going to run a marathon, get back into CrossFit hard core, master the LSAT and score a 160 or above, and get a full ride to a good T50 law school. And put out a sequel to my last novel The Killing Queens Book 1 and use that money to help save for law school.

But now who knows? I can’t even deep breathe or lie down without feeling like I’m drowning. And it comes and goes in waves. I was solid earlier. I could study and follow along for a webinar fine. Then I felt like I got hit by a bus and just wanted to lay under the covers and watch Onward. 

And work...well my Starbucks manager was concede with getting my shifts covered which was good. My Kroger manager just wanted to know if I had COVID-19 and wasn’t pleased when I said there was a 5 day wait. 

I just...want my life back. I promise I’ll workout a lot more and get down to 130 by the end of the year. I’m already down 7 pounds.

Hi everyone,
My state has a requirement that all businesses must maintain social distancing (6 feet between people). How is this possible at our stores? I know that leaning out the window at DT puts me within that distance. And working with a DTR and DTO, not to mention double barring, puts partners WAY closer.
Are any stores actually following this? I’ve been really debating taking the 30 days (judge me if you must, I’m needing the extra pay right now, since I just lost my other job).

I just have a concern about the way we are dealing  with the virus, since now we are serving first responders by a larger quantity we become first responders too by serving them or anybody at this point, everytime somebody pay with cash or credit card they are highly transmitting the virus inside the shop, no matter how much we clean there is contact all day long  there is not six feed distant , somebody can cough at the bill and now it’s inside the shop and now we potentially passing to the next customer by handling their beverage ,and for me probably speeding it and bringing it to my family. Why the same person that takes the money gives the coffee?
My point is if we quarantine aren’t we breaking the quarantine using cash or credit cards? 
The only way to help with the situation it’s by taking only digital payments like Apple Pay, tap, Starbucks app. Or have a separate person receiving payments and other just giving the coffee.
( why Starbucks headquartered haven’t promote to use the app?
Don’t this way they get more data, making people get the coffee by the app? Don’t you know that when people order online it make it faster for us to serve and they always order more than just the coffee ? And also and more importantly protecting your partners and the community?

Hey! Does anyone know exactly how they are obtaining an average to get paid if you're not working? The way I did it was added total hours worked from 2/3-3/1 and then divided the total by 4 since there were 4 weeks total. My average and the average my SM sent me were off.

"I know this thread is probably at a lull, but I have questions regarding policies around illness and bereavement. Our store has been open since the end of April, and our store has gone through one 2 week shut down, And three quarantines, mostly involving our morning crew. In that time I have noticed that a lot of partners have not been taking 30 minute breaks, as it is by law that anybody that works takes a 30 minute break over six hours of working time, I have also noticed that partners are still having to “find coverage” when they are ill, or are going through a bereavement stage. I used to be in contact with an SM that told me at one point that if you are sick and/or are unable to come in because of being sick, your SM is responsible for finding the coverage, or if you are going through bereavement, that is also the responsibility of your SM. I am doing research to see how true this is, because my SM has constantly told us to find coverage for illness, or bereavement issues.

I texted my store manager multiple times and called and left 2 voicemails trying to let them know the symptoms hadn't gone away fully, and asking what I should do because I was told the meetings held this week (mine was supposed to be today) are mandatory and this week only.

Today I called again, and texted again, because while some symptoms went away others developed and I don't want to bring anything possibly contagious to my store, to the public or my fellow partners. I called my doctor to hopefully get in so I can be certain what's going on, but I was told I need to either come today or reschedule for later this week. I feel that's kind of reckless with the current state of things since there's no guarantee how things will be today, tomorrow or later this week.. after getting off the phone I was told my manager was very angry and had an attitude.

If you are new or didn’t work February 3rd- March 1st you will just be paid 20 hours a week for barista, 28 for shift.

"Have you considered getting an antibody test when it becomes available?  It is possible that you had COVID-19 but depending on when you had symptoms, the testing protocols may had said test for flu or consider other illnesses, diseases or conditions first.  I ran into this issue with getting tested when I did have a variety of symptoms that could had been from having COVID-19 or being exposed to SARS-CoV-2. 

While the antibody test does not guarantee immunity nor indicate that you can not acquire the virus again, it does provide information in how you handled exposure - symptoms, recovery.  And also may help to consider how to handle a secondary exposure.  Also start thinking about how you would be able to provide a list of contacts for tracing if you do test positive (which I hope you do not..stay as safe as possible) in the future.  I had not thought through how I would handle the contact tracing if I tested positive and I started to stress about it once I was able to get tested.

This virus hit the world so fast in terms of proving lack of preparedness that I would not be surprised if a lot of people have not already been exposed and/or acquired the virus.

That reminds me, I have a question from a partner - this person is under the impression that, under option 2, ""Partner subject to recall based on business needs"" means they can be called in to work for a single shift (like when someone no-shows or calls in sick). I told them that no, they'd be on a leave of absence and if they brought them in before the 120 days, it would be to begin genuinely working again, not for single-shift fill-ins.

However, I don't have a source that backs up what I say, and the word 'recall' hasn't been defined anywhere. If anyone has more info as to what the rules of the 'recall' are beyond ""depending on business needs"", I'll pass the info onto this partner.

P.S.: Was going to save this for a new thread, but might as well toss it in here. Some of us feel that option 3, the separation package, is maybe a 'too good to be true'. It's a fantastic separation package, more than anyone would ever receive under normal circumstances, but there's also a point to consider: very few businesses are hiring right now - if anyone's considering this, make sure you've got a plan for what happens after quitting, or you'd be out of a job. It's possible option 2+unemployment is better, as it gives more time to find other work, and come back to Starbs if that falls through.",18.0,2020-06-05 14:37:52,1.0,pos,0.9844576109628007,0.015542389037184492

"So essentially I'm being forced to quit 

Because the LOA is extremely conditional.  It says ""if we call you to work, you will work""

My boyfriend is returning to in person work.  My special needs kid is out of school, and I've been getting 6-8 hours a week.  If I take the leave of absence at any time my manager can tell me ""come back"" and I have seven days to figure out what to do with a child with level 3 autism who I have to homeschool, and maybe work around my boyfriend's muh more important job.

My availability has gone from weekends only, to now Sundays only Because my stores hours 100% preclude me working after he gets home from work and he is going back to doing Saturday work at his family business.

My availability used to be school hours and Sunday which gave me 26-30 hours every week.

If I stay they can fire me for not being available

If I take the loa they can fire me for not coming back with 1 week.

There is no contingency for people with extraordinary circumstances.   

So not a special needs parent who is, in essence, a single parent (yes I have a boyfriend but he is not my child's father) is being forced to quit.

"I'm a barista at a store in NY. I have been on a medical leave of absence from September-April. The week I was supposed to go back to work, they closed down my store for about a month and reopened May 4th. I took the unpaid LOA until June. Now, I wanted to go back to work, but due to the high volume of partners at the store and little hours available, my manager suggested that I take the ""Covid LOA"" (option 2). I think it is a great opportunity because I am eligible for NYS unemployment as well as the CARE act. I am really thankful for it. However, the only downside I have to these hour cuts (for both option 1 and 2) is that it affects my scholarship for SCAP. Are there any other ASU students who are having trouble with this?  My manager said he would talk to our DM, but it is unlikely that I will be able to have enough hours to qualify for the SCAP in the fall. This will force me to take a semester off in order to work the mandatory amount of hours in order to qualify. Just curious about how the other partners in the ASU program feel about this.

"> I told them that no, they'd be on a leave of absence and if they brought them in before the 120 days, it would be to begin genuinely working again, not for single-shift fill-ins. 

You're correct--they'd be brought back in and that would be the end of their LOA. So if the business has needs for them then they would be recalled and be back to being scheduled. However, they would have a minimum 7-day notice of this occurring.

In the Partner Care and Preferences FAQ PDF:

> **Q: Can my SM ask me to come back earlier than the 120 days on COVID LOA?**    
> A: Yes, as the business returns to a new normal and SMs understand customer traffic, partners may be requested to return to work if a reasonable schedule can be provided to the partner. If a SM needs a partner to return to work prior to the 120 days, the SM will contact the partner in advance. The partner will be provided at least 7 days from the date of their recall before their first scheduled shift, but the partner may request to have up to 14 days to prepare for the return to work.",16.0,2020-06-05 15:04:39,1.0,pos,0.9955817986973646,0.0044182013026370535

"Being on a leave of asbence still allows you to continue to participate in SCAP but the LOA doesn't 100% protect your eligibility. SCAP eligibility is dependent on your 2 bi-annual BEN audits that occur in Jan and July.

To maintain your eligbility for the next period, you will need to meet the July 5th audit of 450 hrs (lowered from 520.)

- **Jan audit** maintains eligibility for: April, May, June, July, August, September    
- **July audit** maintains eligibility for: October, November, December, January, February, March

If you do not meet your July audit, you will lose your benefits eligibilty on Sept. 30th. If you log into mysbuxben (or mypartnerinfo for paystubs), you can find your current BEN hours to see if you've already met your audit amount or if you still need to more hours.

LOA guarantees 20/hrs minimum per week that will be put towards the current ben audit period. June 15th - July 5th(?) put towards your July audit with July 6th - Sept 30 LOA weeks would be put towards the Jan audit.

Edit:  Some things to note about LOA, from the benefits plan description:

> #**Pay while on a leave of absence**    
> All leaves of absence are unpaid; however, certain pay replacement options may be available or required depending on the type of leave you are on.

>**Sick Time while on leave**    
You may substitute any available sick time when not receiving Short Term Disability pay. Sick time is not
available when taking Military, Personal, or Career Coffee Break (sabbatical) leave and as detailed below on
the chart. A partner eligible for Short Term Disability pay may be eligible to receive partial reimbursement of
lost wages if taking leave due to his or her own serious health condition. See the Short Term Disability chapter
for more information, and refer to the chart below. If you are receiving Short Term Disability pay, you are not
eligible to use available sick time or vacation pay

to use available vacation pay during any other leave when not receiving Short Term Disability (STD), Parental

Partners were clocking out more exhausted than ever because we are all having to work 2x as much to cover the lack of labor.

> Q: When can I expect my Separation payment?

> A: Documents in your separation packet will include details regarding separation pay with an explanation of when you can expect to receive your payment. If you return your Release Agreement within a timely manner, you can expect to receive your separation payment within two regular pay periods of the agreement’s effective date. The method of payment will be in the form in which you typically received your regular pay (i.e., direct deposit, check, etc.). Please note that in some states separation pay will be included in your weekly income to determine your unemployment benefits for that week. While the Federal Pandemic Unemployment Compensation (FPUC) program is in effect until the end of July individuals receiving at least $1 in state unemployment compensation in a week are eligible for an additional $600 for that week. You should check your state’s unemployment agency’s web site to determine the impact of separation pay on weekly benefits. It may be in your interest to delay returning your signed separation agreement in order to avoid losing eligibility for the FPUC benefit in one or more weeks. Starbucks cannot advise you on this issue but we will accept separation agreements returned in August.

Is your state's UI application asking for this form from the employer that's giving you severance?

"In Seattle for some businesses depending on size, you can't have your shift changed by more than 15 minutes without worker approval. If they won't change, you can require them to work the shift and pay an additional hour of labor for the short notice. Refusing a predictability funded change is like refusing a scheduled shift. If you get cut early by more than 15 minutes you get an additional hour of pay.

Realistically nobody I know has been punished for refusing predictability pay to stay. It's more a carrot than a stick.

Seattle also requires a ""good faith estimate of hours"" for average hours per specific worker and has protections if that is violated and reported. Which is partly why I believe these preferences were even offered, Seattle requires notice and consent to reduced average hours.",3.0,2020-06-07 04:38:32,1.0,pos,0.9991878731544656,0.0008121268455432012

"Refusing a predictability funded change is absolutely NOT the same as refusing a scheduled shift. It specifically says in the ordinance that the worker can refuse the hours. The predictability pay is an incentive. Note this applies to extending/adding shifts. Obviously if you’re sent home you can’t demand to stay.

Okay, you do you and you follow your own church, but I'm strong enough in my convictions to smile and say ""no, thank you"" without feeling pressured or bullied. I'm Catholic myself and do not practice evangelicalism (Catholics dogmatically believe that ""spreading the word of God"" means living out Jesus' teachings by being kind, giving until it hurts, opening your hearts and the doors of your church for whatever community needs arise, and doing what you can to behave like Jesus did... And I'm the first to admit most Catholics do this very, very wrong). REGARDLESS of how you feel about evangelicalism, fake-tipping is shitty behavior. Jesus was friends with prostitutes, queers, criminals, dangerously-ill people, etc. He would never have faked somebody out for ""feel-good"" points. He'd be kind and leave an actual tip.

"LGBT rights is actually one of the main reasons I was drawn there. I'm not LGBT, but I find the way that since ""Christians"" treat LGBT hard to square with the teachings of Jesus.

I moved to another country to marry my wife and I went to church with her mother in law. We'd do the Catholic Church and then the episcopal church on alternate weeks. Each week I'd look at the calendar and if I saw it was the Catholic Church I'd think ""ugh, I'm going there again this week"".  Then I thought "" well if that's how I feel... Why don't I just so going there and go to the episcopal church instead? The Catholic Church is five, but I take don't know anyone there and I'd go in and out each week and barely talk to anyone. It was like a trip to the grocery store. It was just a huge church and nobody knew it even tried to get to know me.

The episcopal church on the other hand is a tiny little church where I know everyone, everyone knows me. 

That was 3 years ago, I'm now on the vestry of the episcopal church and I'm currently running their livestreaming efforts.

"Your own crew is also likely to know your drink, rather than you try to explain it to baristas that think you're a crazy Karen until you show them your ID and numbers. If you're doing a lot of mods (or doing simmering that isn't even a normal drink) it can agitate another store's baristas for sure.

Drive through times are tight, as well. At least in my district, they want times at checkout to be less than 45 seconds. That means the drink has to be done and in their hands, plus complete payment, while managing some kind of customer connection in an extremely brief period of time. The more mods and the longer a drink takes, the more of a hit it is against that time.

"If the job is meant for high school or college students, please explain to me all the benefits for parents.

Also, why the fuck are all retail jobs considered ""entry level"" ""not meant to make a lifetime career out of""?  Do you expect all adults over 30 to work in an office?  Do you expect high school and college students to be the store managers and district managers?  Or are people just supposed to wander into those jobs from elsewhere with no understanding of what the people under them do every day.

People working at Starbucks deserve a living wage.  People working at McDonald's deserve a living wage.  People deserve a living wage.  Do you know countries that aren't America have laws in place that require fast food to provide living wages and vacation time to their employees?  Do you know that those countries still have fast food because, shockingly, companies can afford to do that if they're forced to?  Starbucks could pay us more.  We could all make a living wage.  They just don't want to, because they wouldn't make millions and millions of dollars for their already-rich muckety-mucks that way.

And aside from all that, I don't want to work in an office.  I don't want a 9-5 desk job; I want to work in food where I can move and chat and make things.

"The reason retail is considered “entry-level” is because it is a job that anybody can get, even people with little or no work experience. These jobs could lead to career opportunities (e.g. store manager, district manager). 

The fact of the matter is more adults than teenagers work in retail. I think in my area the average age is late twenties or early thirties. That said, retail is not a great career path. It can take years to become a SM or DM, and there aren’t a lot of DM jobs to begin with. While the DM wage is decent, lifetime earnings will be lower if you worked your way up. 

You can go to college and earn more than DMs out of school at 21.

"the benefits are a big reason. free college, free coffee, free food and free drinks for starters. the pay isn't bad and you get tips, good healthcare, and a bunch more if you look into it. it's very stressful and a lot of corporate things arent going well, so a lot of partners need to vent. for example I had a good day overall but one customer was bad and I was considering venting about it here. not my whole job is bad, but blowing off steam about some things that happened to some people that can relate make things better sometimes.",4.0,2020-09-15 08:54:38,69.0,pos,0.9985361751809577,0.0014638248190406255

"^^^ this explains why i chose the job, my current store is just overall poorly managed, I am a barista handling shift duties and am very capable of being a shift, yet the manager claims we are at capacity even though we just had a shift quit. One of the shifts at my store is extremely petty and big headed and acts as if he’s the store manager even though he cant even do the order correctly. The night block for Monday, Wednesday, Friday, and Sundays is usually over staffed, yet my closing crew has 4 people from usually from 3-9pm, so we usually only are able to take our 30s during an 8 hour shift. This Saturday, me and my team mate clocked out for our 30s but kept working because we were not about to just leave the other people hanging. it’s extremely ridiculous and no matter how much we complain nothing ever changes so we’re just going to transfer as a group to a new drive thru store that’s opening up near us.

"I’m a SSV. Our manager has been very vocal about how they think COVID is being way overblown and it’s all ridiculous. That made partners feel uncomfortable and that their worries weren’t going to be taken seriously. So #1) watch what you say around your team and make sure they feel comfortable being honest with you. 

Also, they take everything personally. Someone calls in sick? Instant bad mood and it’s taken out of everyone on the floor. Someone puts in their two weeks? She gives them the cold shoulder and doesn’t ask why. So #2) don’t make yourself the focus. If you stay calm, so will they. 

Basically we have a huge problem at our store because everyone is scared of our manager because she will flip out at the smallest thing. When peak hits it’s not “how can we help the customer” it’s “what does the manager need”. Everyone caters to her. A great manager is one that supports their team, not the other way around.

"I think communication and listening is most important from my leader. Sometimes I just need you to listen to me whine about how annoying something is. Sometimes I need you to listen to me when I tell you that this person isn't a great fit for us, and these are the reasons why. Also, just telling people what's going on in the store helps keep them more involved and makes you feel like you're part of things.

Things that are detrimental for me is feeling like my SM doesn't care if I struggle or appreciate me. I know we are all over worked and underpaid, but all that is a little less crappy when my SM regularly tells me that he thinks I'm doing a great job and that he appreciates my efforts in the store. (also he always says ""call me if you need anything"" as he's leaving. It's kind of obvious, and maybe a little insincere since he always says it, but also I kind of love it because it means that even if he isn't in the store with me, he's still got my back.)

Also writing great schedules super helps! Plus finding coverage when call outs happen is awesome! Fixing my problems before they are my problems? Yes please! Also just little things. Someone was an hour late to their shift, it was the middle of peak and I was on drive bar on admin day.

"With a properly functioning windscreen turned on, which is a requirement nonetheless. Enough pressure is pushed out that window that it’s going to be near impossible for any droplets to make it into the building. This has been posted by Starbucks and many of the major Healthy and Safety organizations. 

You are more likely to pass droplets to them as the pressure goes out and down. 

Even without the windscreen on. The passive airflow in the building and the opening of your front entrance should still create a significant draft out.

Face shields are allowed already and will be available to order in October for DTW partners. As for anybody who gets snow. Your window will be closed with the heater on in just a few weeks. So it’s one less thing you don’t have to worry about. The face shield will be the same protection as a plexiglass partition. 

The only real areas of contact are money/debit-credit terminal and handing out product. Terminal can be cleaned after each use if they don’t have Tap with single use Red Sani Cloths (typical in Clover stores) or you are allowed to have a bin (the same that goes under your espresso bar) with sani solution and a cloth. 

Just make sure it’s not soaked or you will fry the terminals screen / security lock. Hand sanitizer should be there for change. And you can use any wire basket to hand items out if you don’t want to physically hold them.",5.0,2020-09-16 11:23:44,77.0,pos,0.9999689094659064,3.1090534090417585e-05

"It’s a public health and safety violation. If it’s -15 to -35 and with a windchill hitting almost -45° degrees Celsius. 

We are allowed to close the window. This was in a communication at some point over the last 3 years. 

Most drivers already roll their windows back up. It’s a loss of heat for your store. It could hurt your DTW person since they can’t have gloves, which also means rotating positions need to be much more frequent. 

It was also suggested to keep it open. Yes. But not that it **had to be.** for indoor seating it becomes unbearably cold. Same with partners. And if I have to go do my own warming or my own Clover/Pour over, turn around to make iced drinks. I’m going to be closing that window. There is zero rule that states it has to be left open. 

So what if you lose some connection stores. Earn them back on nailing a perfect speaker box order taking, going fast, efficient and giving out the right drinks.  Seal the deal when you hand everything off to them. Of course you can still talk if you want but it’s not required. Your health is more important. Especially when it comes to frost bite.

Fight the bottles that count. I’m sure a face shield and a plexiglass will fog up wonderfully with a required mask to still be worn under it. Explain the situation to your SM and DM. Talk with PCC. Yes try and engage when you can. But I’d that’s not possible. Close the window. It makes it better for everybody else.

"I’d it gets to that point. Phone PCC. All partners can deny being out in a position they don’t feel comfortable or safe in and freezing to death 100% is acceptable. 

With the windscreen + heater on anyways. I usually get more complaints and I have multiple death or hard or hearing DT customers. It’s a challenge to accommodate for them. We’ve worked out solutions and moved on. 

I don’t think anybody in upper management having somebody get hurt by frost bite or water + finger + metal = ouch situation. You come first. Not connection scores.

"Starbucks has an ethics statement that you can access from the partner hub that lays out the ethical standards they hold their suppliers to. Since we can’t post internal documents, I’ll describe the steps to get there.

Log into the Partner Hub. On the main page, under one of the submenus, there is a section about Ethical Sourcing. Click on the one that reads “Manufactured Goods”.

In the section entitled “What Are Our Standards?”, there is a PDF. Click on that. That takes you to a 4-page document entitled “Starbucks Supplier Social Responsibility Standards: Manufactured Goods and Services”. 

TBH, as someone who has a deep knowledge of the prison system of the United States, I found the language a little unsettling and squirrelly, especially around the issue of prison labor. Starbucks has used US prison labor in the past to produce holiday items, and, when asked about it today, defaults to the language in this document, that Starbucks, “will not tolerate the use of any forced or involuntary labor, either directly or indirectly, by our suppliers, contractors or subcontractors. This includes the use of slave labor, bonded labor, indentured labor or involuntary convict labor.”

But the problem is that most “jobs” in jails and prisons, while “voluntary” on paper, are highly coerced. In many, you are required to hold a job, and are punished if you don’t. And even the ones where it’s isn’t strictly “required”, if you “choose” not to take one, you are disproportionately targeted for abuse and harassment by CO’s. Your stay is harder. You don’t earn as much “good time” credit. Holding a job in prison is seen as a sign of reform and responsibility at parole hearings - not holding one is seen almost as if the person is just one step away from falling right back into a life of crime.

My point is, you can’t truly call prison labor voluntary. And I think Starbucks knows that. And my gut tells me they still use prison labor, but it’s okay because the inmates said they were cool with it guys right? That makes it okay? It’s a special job that paid a few more dollars and got the prisoners a few extra perks. So they had them sign an NDA and a contract saying they were voluntary signing up for this job and added then word “involuntary” before “prison labor” because corporate-speak.",7.0,2020-09-16 15:10:17,92.0,pos,0.9999961127164709,3.887283565286692e-06

"This is a really good starting point in terms of looking for red flags -- and you certainly found one.

But honestly, the problem doesn't have an easy solution. The question, does Starbucks use ethical labor can only be answered one of two ways:

1) Finding proof that they use unethical labor at any given point in the supply chain

2) Examining each and every step of the supply chain for every single product.

Obviously, given the scale and complexity of the Starbucks operation, #2 isn't viable. Which means we're essentially left trying to prove a negative. Personally, I find a policy document entirely inadequate to prove anything. That's just their ""official"" stance. To develop confidence that this policy is being upheld, I think we'd need to look for the internal checking processes and enforcement methods.",1.0,2020-09-16 16:53:22,92.0,pos,0.9999697653670226,3.023463296964571e-05

Teaching the Green Beans to check in with the shift before they go could potentially make a huge difference down road when they're no longer green. But the shifts need to be prepared to set tasks for anyone who's leaving, too.

You do have to fill out a FAFSA but you do not need to be eligible to receive funds, so you'll need to do that portion of the ASU SCAP application. It's just a requirement in the chance that you CAN receive aid that way first then they want that to be utilized to minimize the amount you'd pay out of pocket.

"We are in a tiny store with 7 employees in the am then suddenly 2-3 employees at 1:30 until close. I work pm. It was Sunday and a busy day in our community so the store was at customer capacity until basically 6pm with three people working (one shift, one person managing the door, and one barista- me). Morning crew kinda screwed us over with the brilliant idea of putting VSC in coffee travelers to account for huge demand from PCCB. *but* they made all this VSC at 6am, leaving it on the counter in the traveler for US to deal with (7 hours later with about 1/3 the staff). We temped it and it was way out of temp (48°-eww) so essentially we dumped like 5 batches of VSC down the sink during a huge rush with like 1.5 people working then had to make more then clean the traveler that doesn’t fit in the sink. I was taking orders and making food and making every drink and the shift stepped in when they could between CS cycle. 

I have never been so close to just walking off the floor. Like fuck guys, I’m not getting paid enough to run around like a chicken and manage the whole store by myself during rush because you can’t delegate hours right or make good decisions.

"I’d like to add that I am just a customer— I worked for Starbucks for years at a very busy Chicago location about 20 years ago—but regardless, it sucks seeing this and all the reactions from baristas about the pumpkin cold foam.

Very few things bring me joy lately; but one small indulgence that I truly look forward to is my grande pumpkin cream cold brew. It sucks knowing it was probably made with contempt. No one wants or needs that energy. Especially now, man. 

I appreciate all my Starbucks folks do for me and others and I know the endless lines of people and changing menu items are frustrating, but please know that you are making one person’s day just a little bit better. I don’t want to feel guilty for ordering a drink I sincerely enjoy that isn’t available year-round because the baristas hate making it.

\- Pull shots into shot glass. Pump required number of shots into shaker, add correct volumetric scoop of ice\[, sequence out to next drink if necessary\].  
\- Pour shots into shaker, shake. The hot espresso will melt some ice, but you will still be short on liquid despite the foam appearing to make it full (""the gap"").  
\- Pour contents into customer's cup. Fill cup with more ice through the foam until you can see the new ice level with the rim of cup.  
\- Add the splash of 2% milk. The splash will fill between the ice and squish some foam while ultimately filling to the top of the cup.

Mastrena 1's only have two hoppers so there will be a decaf machine, and the other one will be for blonde. Both can also pull regular espresso. On the blonde machine, you'll hit the decaf button for shots because the blonde beans go in the decaf hopper.

If your shots pull too slow, there's a knob to adjust grind. It should Tell you when you need to do it. Pull three sets of double shots after turning the knob to give it time to calibrate.

I mean you are well within your rights to lock your till - that’s on you - when you leave for the day you can always go ahead an unassigned yourself as needed - if you get push back from SSVs about it talk to your manager,13.0,2020-09-15 12:59:48,163.0,pos,0.6697303900012144,0.3302696099987821
"“Till audits will be coming”? Man, it sounds like your manager wasn’t doing their job and got chewed out by their dm during a recent ppv visit where they looked at the p+l and discovered a larger discrepancy in cash shortage than usual. Your manager won’t be able to do retroactive till audits. But I imagine the statement was meant more so as a ‘going forward’ type of statement, though the reality is that they should have been doing this all along, as it has been pointed out, at least twice a week. 

But yeah, it just takes time building the habit of logging out of your till when going on break or leaving for the day, but that’s really all you need to do. As long as you haven’t been mismanaging money, then you don’t have anything to worry about. They do also have cameras pointed at every single register. I’ve seen a few partners get separated for stealing money, sometimes not even on their own till, and in each instance Starbucks made sure to go through the camera footage so they knew, since that way that partner couldn’t come back and say, ‘well, my manager just counted wrong and didn’t do the audit correctly’, or something like that.",3.0,2020-09-15 14:42:03,163.0,neg,0.44395984437549957,0.5560401556245033
"A till audit happens whenever an SM counts down a till. SMs are supposed to do at least 2 per week to check to make sure everyone is being accurate with money and ringing things up. As long as the till is within $5 or 5% then everything is ok (So long as there isn't a pattern of consistently being short $5)

Protect yourself, make sure you lock your till whenever you step away, even briefly. If someone insists that you share your till you can and should refuse, and report that to the SM or partner resources. Never ring on someone else's till. Official policy is still no till sharing. if business is slow you may only be using the left or the right side, but you can still use both the top and bottom to avoid sharing.",2.0,2020-09-15 14:07:55,163.0,pos,0.9913643018213727,0.00863569817862979

"There is nothing you can do directly to incentivise, the company simply doesn't give us the resources to do that, outside of the occasional couple large pizzas after a decent DT week.

But what you can do is offer support and coaching. Ask what's on their mind. Find out what is important to them about this job, and what obstacles they are facing during their shifts. Sometimes just talking these problems out is a help already, but often this discourse can help the team brainstorm solutions together rather than waiting for your leaders to fix it. 

You'll also find that affirmation and support in the moment can also be very impactful on the Partner experience in that shift.

"1. Questions about what you know about Starbucks and the founder. Usually “tell me about a time” questions where you had to deal with a conflict at work, you provided exceptional customer service (for this, you can use an example from your job and just state you were serving an “internal customer” like your boss, or the theatre customers), or use your problem solving skills. 

Hypotheticals like how would you handle an angry customer (apologize, ask what you can do to make the moment right, remake the drink or offer to treat them to their next one with a recovery card) or a really busy store (focus on maintaining standards while working quickly to minimize the wait, thank customers for their patience and use their long wait times to make customer connections...you can also emphasize that you are calm under pressure and enjoy the energy of a busy workplace).

2. One of the best ways to show you’re good for customer service is just through your personality and demeanour. Smile, be friendly to everyone (eg, when you show up and let the barista at the register know you’re here for an interview, start with “Hi, how are you”, etc.). You can state that you are looking for something customer-facing because you enjoy interacting with people and making their day brighter with a special drink. Something about how Starbucks is known for going above and beyond to make our guests feel welcome and it means a lot to you that everyone who comes in leaves feeling happier than they were before. Stuff like that. 

3. Black pants and a button-down shirt, maybe with a sweater over it if the weather permits? That always looks nice without looking too dressy. 

Try to spend some time practicing your answers to common questions like I listed above, so you aren’t caught off-guard. Mostly just relax and be positive - they aren’t looking for tons of experience, just a good attitude and someone who seems willing to learn.

Good luck!!",2.0,2020-09-15 08:49:45,192.0,pos,0.9999999275073141,7.249272349452387e-08

A rattlesnake will have a thicker body and thicker/triangular head with slit pupils compared to a rat snake, which has round pupils.",34.0,2020-09-14 09:26:36,197.0,pos,0.6976748021739987,0.3023251978260049
