This thread has been edited every time a new update is released publicly in the hopes of keeping everyone updated and in the know.  We are now at the point where everything is calming down, and worry is settling in... ""What happens after May 3rd?"" The answer is...we begin to return to life as normal. Those who are high-risk or living with high-risk people, speak with your SM and PCC.  Everyone else - keep an eye out, keep washing your hands and social distancing as possible, and stay safe!!

#**WHAT DOES THIS MEAN FOR ME?**

You have three options: stay with the hour/labour cuts, and keep your benefits; take a Leave of Absence (LOA) for *up to* 120 days (ending on September 30th) and keep your benefits but you do not have job security; or be separated from the company and paid out what you worked, where you may or may not be eligible for rehire.  Options 2 or 3, you may or may not be eligible for state unemployment - **THIS DEPENDS ON YOUR STATE.**

Be aware that these are carefully worded for legal reasons!! Starbucks is a CORPORATION that cares about itself and the primary money-makers FIRST.  These are OPTIONS, essentially this is what you are requesting.  Note, ""Partner is expressing the *preference* to separate"" - if you are told no, you cannot use this option, and you QUIT ON YOUR OWN - YOU WILL NOT BE ELIGIBLE FOR UNEMPLOYMENT AT ALL. From /u/cupperoni, [HERE IS A BREAKDOWN OF UNEMPLOYMENT INFORMATION BY STATE!](https://www.dropbox.com/s/g0dbylvc80l3mly/State_Unemployment_Compensation_Eligibility_Details_-_US-CO.xlsx?dl=0)

Loving The New Third Place Policy,https://www.reddit.com/r/starbucks/comments/itb23q/loving_the_new_third_place_policy/,"So this just happened, earlier a regular came through drive and sped off without taking his card, not the Baristas fault because the card reader is outside the window. No biggie, we put it where we put all the cards that guests leave and continue throughout our day. He comes back like 2 hours later, I’m on bar so I hadn’t seen who left the card so I assume he’s wanting to order but he has NO MASK on, I move to the register to give him a disposable mask but he walks over to the end of the bar by our back room where the manager is and says “I need my card back” my manager says “Okay would you mind waiting outside while we get it for you since you’re not wearing a mask” the guy straight up just says “No just give me my fucking card” my manager says “Alright man just calm down we’re getting it for you” I think he said something about him being inside without a mask but I can’t be sure. The guy then starts complaining about how he had to drive back up the hill (we live in a really small town and are the only SBUX in town) to come back for his card when HE left it. Manager slides it to him across the top of the pastry case and the guy rushes out . My manager gets on the headset and says “If that guy ever comes in here and talks to you guys like that tell him not to come back, this is why we just revised the Third Place Policy so you guys don’t have to deal with that kind of stuff” and honestly I couldn’t be more proud of my manager in that moment.",748,2020-09-16 03:30:37,3

He gets to register and keeps pulling off his mask to cough while here is ordering. He’s not just coughing like he has a tickle in his throat but he’s like hacking, coughing. Our SM was on bar so she could see exactly what was going on but wasn’t acknowledging it. This went on for at least 3 minutes while he ordered and every one in the cafe was uncomfortable but our SM didn’t care. I said to her “he keeps taking his mask off and coughing right in front of POS” she responded with “we will sanitize that area when he’s gone.” The coughing continues so I was about to say something to him myself but my fellow shift lead stepped up and offered him a cup of water and the politely asked him to wait for his drink outside if he is unable to control his coughing. She handled it perfectly and he stepped outside no problem. I was just so frustrated with our SM. That she would put us and all of our customers at risk just to avoid a possible confrontation.

Advice on store drama? [Trenta rant],https://www.reddit.com/r/starbucks/comments/itnzpi/advice_on_store_drama_trenta_rant/,"Hi all, I need advice from anyone that has experience with handling drama in their store. I have worked at my store for a long time, and remember when everyone used to get along and we had a stress-free environment. Now every time I walk into work there's a new story or fight going on.

**The problems:**

1. My store has a SSV and Barista that are dating. They demand my SM schedule them together, demanding 35-40 hours each. Whenever this does not happen, they bully my SM into giving them hours. This has caused several partners to lose hours, which is incredibly unfair. **Not only this, but they both call out of their shifts constantly!** Multiple times they've lied about why they're calling out, and nothing has ever been done to reprimand them (my SM has literally made jokes about how much they call out but never punishes them for it ..?)
2. My Store Manager has no backbone. He walks away from people while they're talking to him, doesn't follow up on anything he says he's going to do, and spends most of his shift in the back or in the bathroom. When he told one of our SSV's he was going to write them up, they screamed at him to the point he literally started crying and didn't write them up. You can't get an answer out of him unless you corner him and force him to answer you.
3. My store has had a ridiculous turnover rate ever since we lost our old crew. We had a team of mostly veteran partners that got along great, however one of them became an ASM and took most of the team to their new store. Since then, 4/5 of the veteran partners & SSV's we had left have quit. All new partners are being trained by the same person, who calls out sick or leaves midway through a majority of their shifts.

I also texted the work group chat and the only other person I have the personal  number of. None of them have answered. Not sure if I should go in, I live a bit far so i would need to leave soon.

Frustrated...is this normal for close?,https://www.reddit.com/r/starbucks/comments/itopli/frustratedis_this_normal_for_close/,"Hey, so I’m still kind of a green bean without a lot of experience on bar. 

Today after I got off my last break around 7 pm, I was told to take drive and cafe bar. I told myself that I’d do my best even though I still really suck at making drinks, but there were three other people on duty with me. It was a little rough at first but we weren’t super busy at the time so I was feeling alright. 

I’m flying around making drinks as fast as possible when all of a sudden I hear the alarm go off because someone’s at the ordering board. So I wait a couple very brief  moments for someone to chime in but they don’t. I look around and I’m the only one in the entire store???

I wasn’t sure what was happening and no one told me anything, so it was just me completely by myself taking orders, ringing people up at the window and making drinks for about 15 minutes before I loudly say “WHY am I the only one here???”. 

Next thing you know one of my partners  comes rushing out from the back to “help” me. She asks me what the people at the window ordered so I snapped and said I didn’t know, I didn’t realize I was supposed to be taking orders. She tells me to “calm down” which just pissed me off even more.

Like wtf don’t fucking tell me to call down when no one is communicating with me and I don’t know what the fuck is going on while y’all goof off in the back. 🤬🤬🤬",7,2020-09-16 16:22:18,36

HELP Customers Lying About Refills,https://www.reddit.com/r/starbucks/comments/itn272/help_customers_lying_about_refills/,"Baristas,

HOW DO YOU ADDRESS THIS???

We constantly have a handful of people coming in daily who come to the register and ask for a refill when we know they haven't placed an order that day (I work mornings so it's not like they came in during the other group's shift). It really bothers my shift supervisors and they always tell us NOT to give them the refill when ringing them up. Typically, I will ring them up as normal until they point out its a refill, to which I ask them, ""you're refilling a drink that you've ordered TODAY?""  They always say yes and have an empty, CLEAN cup with them. I really don't know how to further confront them and deny them the refill after questioning and it only angers my shifts more. I can't always have a shift ring them up as we are a VERY busy store and sometimes they struggle confronting them too. And as our seating is closed, I can't even tell them they must stay in-store for the refill, either.

It's so awkward to tell a stranger I know that they are lying and its unfair they put us in this position every day. We're supposed to give the customer the benefit of the doubt and they KNOW that and abuse it. What do you think is the best way to deny them and to get them to stop scamming us???!!!

P.S. I get that people struggle but its a cup of coffee (that's $2-3 and not a necessity)!!! And they shouldn't get a cold brew if they can't afford one!!!",7,2020-09-16 14:33:36,42

Covid,https://www.reddit.com/r/starbucks/comments/it863n/covid/,"
Yesterday we my last day at Starbucks, which consisted of me dumping everything and making sure everything was cleaned because we had another partner come in sick and also we had a partner test positive for covid. Their solution was to bring partners from other stores into our store without telling them our store was exposed to COVID and have them work blindly to all this. They also allowed customers to come in without wearing a mask and never said a word to them about having to put one on. At 14 weeks pregnant they didn’t care at all that I was being exposed to all this and so was my child, bc I wasn’t in “close contact” with these partners I was expected to come in and work. Even though partners that did work with these individuals were still coming to work bc they are considered not in “close contact”. The amount of stress I put on myself and my child is not worth the $12 an hour. I loved everyone I worked with and will miss them all so much but I had enough of working for terrible corporations and shitty management.

I was like wtf and asked him if everything was alright but he kept threatening me so I just walked away and started making other drinks. Luckily, my SM stepped up and told him that he can't be talking to us like that and he should leave. Funny thing is that his wife is a regular at our store and everytime she can't come in for her drink, he would come in for her. In my opinion, he should've asked me or my SM FIRST as soon as he came in if the drink was ready and not just lurk in the shadows and expect me to sense that his presence is in the store cause I dont know if you're here or not since I'm too busy busting my ass soloing bar while customers are bugging/askinf me about the status of the food they ordered.

on my very first day of work i couldn’t remember one guys name but i could remember that he ate chicken and rice for lunch... i have called him chicken and rice since
one of my coworkers always sings disney songs at the top of his lungs. usually not the ones playing either. his favorite is hakuna matata.
i have a regular come thru every evening that orders 4 trenta green teas and a trenta cold brew and he is so kinda and wonderful. 
a coworker of mine always wears adidas and always slips after we mop the floor. i now make fun of her when i mop and tell her not to slip. 
whenever we have mobile stickers from our drive thru we stick them to whoever is on DTO. 
my supervisors don’t give a flying f about my septum piercing because we’re always wearing masks.


ok but on the other hand...
we are always out of breakfast sandwiches. ALWAYS. 
and cold brew. why tf can no one make cold brew. 
someone broke the ice bucket and now we use a tati for ice. 
someone also broke the ice machine one day and we very quickly ran out of ice. it’s 100 degrees outside and we don’t have any damn ice. people were angry.
we ran out of pumpkin sauce. i swear i thought i would die that day. 
this one girl comes through and orders a grande iced skinny cinnamon dolce latte with an add shot made with nonfat milk and no whip in a venti cup with extra ice, shaken and then add pumpkin cold foam with extra pumpkin sauce, and psl topping. i hate her. you’d have to meet her to understand but just know her order is only a fraction of how annoying she is. 
i can’t bar and instead of putting me on bar with someone else, my supervisor decided to just throw me on it at 5pm ALONE. 
i always kill shots. i cannot psychically multitask and when i try to i kill shots. 
i got yelled at for not aerating my milk for long enough when i was literally trained to do it for 5 seconds. what more do you want from me. 
i bled thru my pants in the middle of a rush. 
i have a regular that hates foam on her chai latte. hates it. she basically wants hot milk in it. and she is rude asf if we don’t do it right.
i had a woman tell me i was stupid and then throw 2 dollars at me and drive away. 
a supervisor yelled at me for not wearing my name tag as i was walking out of the back room holding my name tag to put on. my shift had just started. 
i spilled half a tati of cold brew in the middle of our floor. 
we just opened a new store and 16 of my coworkers left to go to the other store. some of my favorites left and i’m very sad about it. 

anyways if you got this far just know, i love my job a lot. i also don’t sometimes. it’s a rollercoaster of some of the best times and the worst but i wouldn’t trade it for anything.",1,2020-09-16 20:51:20,60

I have been an externally hired store manager for just about a year and though the job can be rough I genuinely enjoy working for Starbucks. I have been in the coffee industry for over 10 years and ran my own cafe for 4. I decided to make the leap from independent to the corporate world. Comparatively, Starbucks takes much better care of me than any other cafe I have worked for. I really care about my team and after having a great shift meeting last night I wanted to get a broader idea of what it is you value in a store manager.

I see a lot of horror stories about managers on here and I hate to see leadership that actively makes their employees lives worse. I’m not perfect but I really try to focus on partner development, consistency, respecting your work-life balance, and really just not taking it too seriously and keeping it lighthearted and fun.

The only thing I know how to do well is DTR, but when it comes to being super busy I feel like I can’t help because I’ve never properly been trained. What should I do? Should I look into transferring stores? I’m trying not to feel discouraged but maybe a drive through location isn’t for me .. it’s very fast paced and I can’t help but feel maybe I wasn’t cut out for it.",7,2020-09-16 04:54:58,82

Just got rehired at a hot mess of a store. Please help,https://www.reddit.com/r/starbucks/comments/itblb4/just_got_rehired_at_a_hot_mess_of_a_store_please/,"Hey everyone. I just recently moved to a new store in a different state, and I’m having a really hard time adjusting. So, at my old store, the SM was reallly strict about following standards, having high scores, and just generally being a good clean store. At my new store, it’s not like that at all. Shifts hardly have any control over the floor, the SM is a lazy pushover, the store is filthy and we don’t even use the sani buckets to keep things clean and safe, especially during the fucking pandemic. Like QASA would have the time of their lives in that store. 

My SM asked me if I go to church. I told him no, then he went on to tell me that this is a “church town” blah blah blah. He also brought up the fact that he wasn’t sure if I was trans or not, But said that starbucks forces him to have an open mind and went on to deadname and misgender one of his former trans partners. Apparently other queer partners have had issues with him in the past. 

I guess what I’m really looking for here is advice on how to move forward. I don’t know if it’s worth trying to fix anything at that store or if I should just transfer. Thoughts? :(",8,2020-09-16 03:57:39,84

So, I applied online through the Starbucks career website to be a barista at a few locations near me. I think all together I applied at about.. 7 different locations? Should I call them if I don’t hear back from them? Or do they usually call you first if they’re interested? I know some places I’ve applied for in the past usually don’t look at their online applications, so I’m just curious if Starbucks would see it, or if I should call them first if I don’t hear anything in a week or so. 

Also another question, do you get the same benefits as a full time employee if you’re only a part time? (I put my availability at up to 30hrs since I have another part time job atm) 

Oh! And one more thing- What are some of the benefits you get with the job? Does it vary store to store, or are they all the same? If so, what are they?",1,2020-09-16 13:40:03,97

got yelled at by a customer today 😎,https://www.reddit.com/r/starbucks/comments/ismv8y/got_yelled_at_by_a_customer_today/,"first customer of the day, right at 5 am. dude wanted 6 shots in a tall cup with steamed half and half to the top. 

a latte. 

i explained to him that i was going to ring it up as a latte and why. he said it was fine. total came down to $9 and he gets mad?? “it’s normally $5”, like bro. you’re getting a six shot latte. i don’t make the rules

also got to pull the “i am the manager” card and it felt great 😎

edit: after reading the comments, i am conflicted. did i do the right thing? or was i just grumpy from having to wake up at 4am? what do you guys think? my understanding was that a cup of espresso can not be filled to the top, otherwise that would just be a latte, so that’s why i rang him up that way, but idk. the cup was literally half espresso, half breve, so more than 4 ounces",82,2020-09-15 03:18:37,145

Starbucks double shot on ice?,https://www.reddit.com/r/starbucks/comments/isvlkw/starbucks_double_shot_on_ice/,"Hi there, i’m a fairly new green bean and so are a lot of my coworkers.. so i’m sorry if this is a silly question. I was on DTW today and a woman came through with a mobile order. she had ordered a venti starbucks double shot on ice and there was a gap between the lid and the foamy bubbles that form from shaking it. It had already been sitting on the counter for a good minute before she came to pick it up though. she angrily said that she didn’t like the gap and that it never looks like that, after i handed the drink over. she didn’t even let me say that we could just remake it before she tried handing it over and she asked for me to “just add more coffee”. i said i was sorry and that i couldn’t take the drink back but that she could keep it. i also explained that there isn’t just black coffee in her drink and that it was actually espresso shots and that i could give her an extra shot in a cup. she got angry and said no she just wants me to fill the gap with coffee and not the heavy cream that she subbed for the 2%. i said that i was sorry again and told her that we could just remake it and that the gap was probably formed from the bubbles going down from sitting for a bit without being touched. she was finally fine with us remaking it after talking to our manager about it and getting angry that i couldn’t take her original drink back. she also cut me off when talking about the bubbles saying that she gets this drink all the time and it NEVER looks like that and that i was wrong. Can someone please explain the gap maybe? did the barista just make a mistake? also sorry if there’s any grammar mistakes i wrote this pretty quick while it was still fresh! thank you!",10,2020-09-15 10:21:05,155

How exactly are till audits conducted?,https://www.reddit.com/r/starbucks/comments/isybrx/how_exactly_are_till_audits_conducted/,"So my manager send out a message to my entire store informing us that a total of $461 has gone missing from deposits over the last three weeks and thus, till audits will be coming. He informed us that anyone +/-$5 will be held accountable. What exactly does this mean? Moving forward, or are they going to look back at all the records they have available? 

I'm concerned because I understand cash management policy as far as not sharing tills, but I recently was rehired at a new store and I've seen baristas working in the evenings using tills registered underneath the opener who left 7+ hours prior. It's an epidemic. Barely anyone actually assigns new tills at this store. Also because I know my till has been used by other baristas while I'm on my break etc and I don't want to be faced with a situation where I'm being asked where money went when I had nothing to do with it being misplaced. I try to lock my till like I've been trained, but sometimes it's such a quick transition that I forget to do so...

I had an interview with Starbucks Tuesday September 8th. I think it went really well and I really want this job, however I haven’t heard anything back.

new shift supervisor who can barely handle basic barista responsibilities,https://www.reddit.com/r/starbucks/comments/isuqcy/new_shift_supervisor_who_can_barely_handle_basic/,"this guy came to our store a few months ago having not worked for months. he was previously hired on as a shift but came to our store as a barista. this man barely knows how to make any drinks to standard, routinely wanders off to make himself an overly complicated for-here drink, touches food with his bare hands, holds up the drive through line with unnecessary conversation (yeah yeah customer connections but it’s a DRIVE THROUGH), and on top of all that, is very uncomfortably flirty with all the female baristas and costumers. he used to touch me pretty much every shift we worked together before i made it clear that it wasn’t okay.

this guy sucks. he’s nice enough i guess, but he’s bad at his job and makes me deeply uncomfortable. and he’s just been promoted to shift, over a partner who’s worked with the company for years, is more than qualified, and was basically promised the position before having it get yanked away from her.

Ideas on how to get the best out of barista for corporate (not that they will listen anyway),https://www.reddit.com/r/starbucks/comments/ishpvo/ideas_on_how_to_get_the_best_out_of_barista_for/,"1. Pay better, while training to be a barista may not require a college degree or extensive education it does have it’s rigorous training, it’s not something that can simply be taught in a day or two, becoming an experienced barista takes skill and technique. It would go a long way to make hazard pay permanent with the stuff we have to deal with give every partner a $3 per hour raise or also do the $15 nationwide wage and for those who are close to $15 or make $15 give the $3 per hour raise in those most expensive states.  In some states we still get baristas barely making $10 per hour and in other states in California in cities like LA we still make $15 per hour but that’s to low for the city we are in. If Target, Amazon, and other business already provide $15 per hour nationwide Starbucks can to. With the type of work we deal with we should get paid more.

2. Better staffing needs to happen. More hours need to be given and they need to focus on good support during the peak hours and good support before closing to ensure everything is being managed properly. Also, store managers should have to work a opening shift at least once a month, a closing shift once a month, and a peak shift once a month on the floor, oftentimes stores get neglected due to SM just being scheduled when they want, true as a manager I bet there are more luxuries but if you want your store to run well occasionally see what happens in these shifts.

3. Stand by your partners. I understand that corporate wants to be a third place to others, however it shouldn’t come at the cost of letting partners getting stepped on. Either a partner would get stepped on or would get in trouble by corporate because corporate would take any word from a Karen. Instead of believing anything a customers say assess the situation and hear the partners side of the story. As a result partners get steeped on and verbally abused by customers because corporate encourages it and on top of that end up giving recovery cards or drinks to said customers.

4. May not really apply to cafe stores but I’m sure cafe stores also deal with certain problems also. In many DT stores we get pestered about customer connections and drive times. It occurs to me that customer connections actually decrease when stores try to push it a lot. Those who drink the Starbucks cool aid will tell me I’m wrong that connecting means to keep talking to a customer but I don’t think they know what an actual connection means. I’m all for being social however society has both introverted and extraverted people and introverted people prefer to avoid confrontation and small talks and it’s pretty evident by the body language. Most people who come through drive thru tend to be introverted also or they also order mobile for those reasons they’ll rather keep the conversation as short as possible, however we get store managers telling us to keep connecting when it’s clear a customer rolled up their window or have their head turned back or go on their phone, these customers don’t want to be bothered. They just want their drinks and then to go. Good customer connections means providing quality service and that quality service can simply just mean getting the order out in a timely manner in most cases most introverts just want to be out of there. Of course it’s good to keep connecting with those who like to be social but instead of trying to force this customer connection, they need to learn to read body language. Also customer connections lower drive time often and they also complain about that, faster drive times actually correlate to better connections because like I said some people just prefer the timely speedy quality service, pick one corporate you can’t expect us to be social butterflies and do 50 other things at the same time. And there is one simple solution to improving this, add Handheld DTO with proper staffing. It solves the biggest problems, for once the person at Window doesn’t have to worry about inputting orders and doing 50 other things at once meaning orders are completed quicker, also the point of contact with Handheld DTO provides better connection opportunities and even allows us to get all the cars orders down in a timely fashion to have the order prepared ahead of time which lowers drive time. It allows the person at window to focus on getting orders out quicker and the DTO person to make great connections.

5. This one is actually more store specific than corporate, it’s really dependent on the store one comes from. Baristas are human also, when a store provides a drama toxic environment they are just setting the whole store to fail and the partner won’t be motivated in anyway. For those shifts who are fair I’m glad you are around, but many stores have shifts that are negligent on helping their team and create a lot of drama, they’ll only listen to the people who kiss their ass and while a hard working barista is trying to get the store under control they’ll be just chatting with one of their favorites not really focusing on the task on hand, if said hard working barista ask for support they perceive it in bad ways, please as a SSV be fair and don’t play favorites. I don’t care which partner is your friend but don’t lag on the rest of us just because someone kisses your ass or is your friend, and then act like it’s our responsibility to watch over everyone. We are human also and don’t deserve to be treated this way.

6. Pay SSV better, while I did vent about how some SSVs act, some don’t get paid enough they have almost as much responsibility as a store manager but don’t get paid that much more than your typical partner by paying SSV even better, you’ll have SSV work harder, you’ll retain the good ones, and more partners would be willing to step in as a leader to be one. Why is that at my store I get paid $15 per hour while my shift only gets paid $17 per hour. A shift should at least get paid $5 more per hour, also that better pay motivates a shift to run a more efficient team so it also benefits partners for shifts to get paid more",54,2020-09-14 21:31:33,167

I realized that I come home drained, exhausted, and grumpy. In the past three years my depression and anxiety have spiked. And the company used me, did not value me. My DM dangled a promotion in front of me for a year, my SM manipulated me, and the Heathers all bullied me. 

But heres to no longer being expected to suck it up when multiple people call out. Its not my fault when window times are slow or Karen is upset. Its not my responsibilty anmore if baristas dont comunicate, or if the sm doesnt listen. 

Sorry starbucks, you dont spark joy and you havnt for a while. Im done.",32,2020-09-14 17:48:55,184

Stonks help!!,https://www.reddit.com/r/starbucks/comments/isxgmh/stonks_help/,"I feel like these are stupi# questions and I apologize in advance.


I believe I vested/claimed my stock last year? The money that is in the individual account means I vested it right? And that they're free to cash out?

If i wanted to cash it out or transfer it to my main bank account, how would that work out, I just link it to my main account right?

And if I were to put my two weeks in, how much time do I have to cash it out?

"I applied and have an interview next week, advice?",https://www.reddit.com/r/starbucks/comments/iss3o4/i_applied_and_have_an_interview_next_week_advice/,"Hello!

I’m a college student who’s applied for a barista position a few weeks ago. Today I called and spoke to a manager who gave me an interview next week and I’m looking for some advice. 

1. What should I expect? Can anyone give me some insight on their experiences with an interview? What type of questions do they ask. 

2. I have minimal prior work experience as a theater technician, but not in customer service. How can I show that I would still be a good candidate for a customer service job with no such background?

3. What should I wear? I don’t want to go too casual or too formal.

advice? venti rant? idk???,https://www.reddit.com/r/starbucks/comments/isrlpe/advice_venti_rant_idk/,"so i’ve posted on here a little bit but this is my first rant/advice seeking post so excuse me if it’s just rambly. it probably will be but i feel bad.

i’ve been at my store for about a month, and over this short period i really have grown to like my coworkers. the thing is, i’ve become a very quiet and introverted person due to bullying issues as a kid, so it’s difficult at first for me to open up and be more outgoing. a month isn’t that long for me, so i’m still relatively quiet and kinda awkward around my coworkers. i feel really bad about it, but trying to force myself out of my shell just makes it worse, so i’m trying to get more comfortable around everyone and slowly get myself to open up.

anyways, recently one of my coworkers texted me asking if i could cover for her last saturday because she didn’t feel well. i asked what time because i had a doctors appt at 9 and my family also made plans, because it was my first weekend day off since i started working. when she told me 630-2, i told her like “hey i’m really sorry but i can’t take it, i have a doctors at 9 i would’ve covered if i could but i can’t.” she texted yeah it’s okay and it ended there. i felt bad but i just couldn’t cover for her that day. 

i come in sunday because that was my next scheduled day, and suddenly most, if practically not all, of my coworkers who were there before me like... cold-shouldered me. like, the entire day. i was on register most of the day, and usually i have these two coworkers who are pretty nice to me talk to me when we’re not busy, but again i was ignored most of my shift. the person i couldn’t cover for was there too, and it felt like whenever i talked to her about an order or whatever, she had sort of an attitude while i talked to her. i can only assume it was cause i couldn’t cover or she just had a rough morning before i came in, but the rest of the store was ignoring me too, so i was like ???? the entire day.

everyone’s shifts end at 1 that day and i’m holed up a bit waiting for the other green bean to come in and take my place, when i walk into the back, clock out, and go to the girl i couldn’t cover and another coworker, they’re talking about like “oh yeah she’s sweet but...” i couldn’t catch the rest but when i walked up it was just. very awkward. so i left the ipad with them, got my markouts and left.

i don’t know if there was something off with everyone or there was a bad start to the morning that it had everyone in a down mood, but it felt like i was being purposefully excluded or something. i might be overreacting, but it just kinda hurt a little bit, especially because i really was just ignored by most everyone on the floor that day.

i just needed to get that out cause it’s been bothering me since yesterday so thanks for like. reading this if you did :P",2,2020-09-15 07:06:08,196

Can I be real a second? For just a millisecond?,https://www.reddit.com/r/starbucks/comments/is8y8m/can_i_be_real_a_second_for_just_a_millisecond/,"There's a customer at my store who is -- and I don't say this lightly -- a horrible person. 

He's super high-maintenance and has always demanded that the barista serving him put on ""A FRESH PAIR OF GLOVES"" before touching any cup or lid (this predates COVID by a lonnngggg time.)

Yesterday I was almost at the end of my shift (5+ hours on front register, ten straight days working) when he came in and ordered a coffee and pastry WITH FRESH GLOVES etc. He pulled his mask DOWN to order it. I asked him to pull his mask up and then asked for his name. (Due to COVID we're printing out stickers for brewed coffee now, so that partners don't all crowd together behind the bar.)

He refused to give a name and again he pulled his mask down to yell at me. He insisted that I get his coffee for him RIGHT HERE, RIGHT NOW. He added, I DON'T HAVE TIME FOR THIS.

I skipped the ""Name"" field on the POS by typing a single period into it. He paid. I then asked him to move down to the handoff plane (10 feet away) so they could hand off his order when it was ready. He refused, and again insisted ""THIS IS FASTER.""

""I promise you it will not be faster,"" said I, and then I felt something threatening to break inside of me so I passed the baton to a very awesome SSV who had just clocked in. I knew this SSV was capable of handling this particular customer's nonsense. Also they had not been on register for FIVE HOURS dealing with people's BS.  I said, ""I can't do register anymore, I will literally die."" The SSV (concerned) whispered, ""Why is he still standing there? Does  he need something?"" and I was like, ""He refuses to move.""

The SSV was like, ""Just do warming"" and I did, like a robot, thankful that my back was to the customers and they couldn't see that I was THIS CLOSE to losing my mind. My SM (on bar) got the coffee but she wasn't wearing FRESH GLOVES and had to get it again, which made me feel worse. I don't know why this man's behavior broke me, but it did. 

Customers, please please please don't be like this guy. Thank you.",83,2020-09-14 11:09:47,198
